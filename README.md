## What is KubeBlocks
**KubeBlocks**, running on Kubernetes, is an open-source data manangement platform. KubeBlocks greatly simplifies the process of deploying databases on Kubernetes. It offers a universal view for multicloud and on-premises databases with a consistent database developing and management experience.

### Goals
- Enable developers using one platform to manage any database engines used
- Provide consistent and easy-to-use declarative API
- Create and use database clusters within minutes without a deep knowledge of Kubernetes
- Relieve the burden of maintaining miscellaneous operators
- Be community driven, open, and cloud neutral
- Embrace extensibility and provide domain functions without vendor lock-in
- Gain new contributors
### Key Features
- Runs on a Kubernetes base on any cloud
- Defines each supported database engine through a declarative API
- Integrated DevOps tools and processes,such as Prometheus, Grafana and AlertManager for monitoring and alarming
- Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB and other database engines
- Accesses and manages any new database engines or plugins by defining CRD
- High availability, based on the consistency X-Paxos protocol
- Database life cycle management
- Backup and restore
- Supports resource overcommitment
- Managed and optimized database security
- Provides kbcli, an easy-to-use CLI command line tool
