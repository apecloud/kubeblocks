# KubeBlocks Security Policy

## Introduction

This document outlines the security policy for the KubeBlocks project, an open-source tool for building and managing stateful workloads, such as databases and analytics, on Kubernetes. The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and best practices to ensure the security of the KubeBlocks project, its users, and the environments in which it is deployed.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all contributors, maintainers, users, and any third-party services utilized by the KubeBlocks project. It covers the project's source code, documentation, infrastructure, and any other resources related to the project.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this security policy are to:

1. Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the KubeBlocks project and its resources.
2. Establish and maintain a secure environment for users to deploy and manage stateful workloads on Kubernetes.
3. Promote a culture of security awareness and best practices among KubeBlocks contributors and users.

## Security Best Practices

### Code and Dependency Management

1. All contributors must follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling.
2. Use static code analysis tools and integrate them into the project's CI/CD pipeline to identify and fix potential security issues before they are merged into the main branch.
3. Regularly update project dependencies to ensure that known security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.

### Access Control

1. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to KubeBlocks resources based on the user's role and the principle of least privilege.
2. Ensure that all actions performed within the KubeBlocks environment are logged and monitored for unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
3. Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to protect access to critical resources.

### Data Protection

1. Ensure that sensitive data, such as credentials, API keys, and tokens, are securely stored and managed, using encryption and secret management tools.
2. Implement proper data backup and recovery mechanisms to protect against data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access.
3. Provide guidelines for users to secure their own data and workloads within the KubeBlocks environment.

### Incident Response

1. Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address potential security breaches and incidents promptly and effectively.
2. Regularly review and update the incident response plan to ensure its effectiveness and alignment with the evolving threat landscape.
3. Communicate security incidents to affected users and stakeholders, as required by law and industry best practices.

### Security Awareness and Training

1. Encourage a security-conscious culture among KubeBlocks contributors and users through regular security training and awareness programs.
2. Collaborate with the open-source community to share security best practices and learn from the experiences of other projects.
3. Provide clear and concise documentation to guide users in securely deploying and managing KubeBlocks in their environments.

## Reporting Security Issues

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported to KubeBlocks privately, to minimize attacks against current users of KubeBlocks before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.

**IMPORTANT: Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until the KubeBlocks security team has had a reasonable amount of time to address the issue.**

If you discover a security vulnerability or have concerns about the security of the KubeBlocks project, please report the issue by emailing the KubeBlocks security team at [kubeblocks@apecloud.com](mailto:kubeblocks@apecloud.com). The team will work with you to address the issue and provide appropriate credit for your contributions.


## Policy Review and Updates

This security policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure its continued effectiveness and alignment with industry best practices and regulatory requirements. All updates will be communicated to KubeBlocks contributors and users through appropriate channels.
