/*
Package experimental is a group of APIs that are in experimental.

We often encounter needs and ideas from community users, customers, or internal discussions.
These ideas or features typically require a lot of preparatory work before they can be officially supported in KubeBlocks.
This includes requirements analysis, solution research, API design and discussions, solution design and discussions, and so on.
This process often takes a considerable amount of time.

To quickly validate the feasibility of feature functionalities, an experimental API is now added to KubeBlocks.
This API is used for rapidly verifying the feasibility of a specific feature.
Please note that experimental APIs do not guarantee backward compatibility.
