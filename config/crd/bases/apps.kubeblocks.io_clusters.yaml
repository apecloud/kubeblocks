          Cluster offers a unified management interface for a wide variety of database and storage systems:


          - Relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
          - NoSQL databases: Redis, MongoDB
          - KV stores: ZooKeeper, etcd
          - Analytics systems: ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, ClickHouse, Doris, StarRocks, Solr
          - Message queues: Kafka, Pulsar
          - Distributed SQL: TiDB, OceanBase
          - Vector databases: Qdrant, Milvus, Weaviate
          - Object storage: Minio


          KubeBlocks utilizes an abstraction layer to encapsulate the characteristics of these diverse systems.
          A Cluster is composed of multiple Components, each defined by vendors or KubeBlocks Addon developers via ComponentDefinition,
          arranged in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topologies.
          The topologies, defined in a ClusterDefinition, coordinate reconciliation across Cluster's lifecycle phases:
          Creating, Running, Updating, Stopping, Stopped, Deleting.
          Lifecycle management ensures that each Component operates in harmony, executing appropriate actions at each lifecycle stage.


          For sharded-nothing architecture, the Cluster supports managing multiple shards,
          each shard managed by a separate Component, supporting dynamic resharding.


          The Cluster object is aimed to maintain the overall integrity and availability of a database cluster,
          serves as the central control point, abstracting the complexity of multiple-component management,
          and providing a unified interface for cluster-wide operations.

                        Allows for the customization of configuration values for each instance within a Component.
                        An instance represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps).
                        While instances typically share a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec,
                        they can require unique settings in various scenarios:


                        For example:
                        - A database Component might require different resource allocations for primary and secondary instances,
                          with primaries needing more resources.
                        - During a rolling upgrade, a Component may first update the image for one or a few instances,
                          and then update the remaining instances after verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly.


                        InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations per instance.
                        Each instance's name is constructed using the pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal),
                        starting with an ordinal of 0.
                        It is crucial to maintain unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts.


                        The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the total number of replicas specified for the Component.
                        Any remaining replicas will be generated using the default template and will follow the default naming rules.

                          InstanceTemplate allows customization of individual replica configurations within a Component,
                          without altering the base component template defined in ClusterComponentSpec.
                          It enables the application of distinct settings to specific instances (replicas),
                          providing flexibility while maintaining a common configuration baseline.

                                                    be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                    incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                    to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                    for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                    pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                        violate MaxSkew(1).

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                                        It's a required field.

                                  description: |-
                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.


                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.


                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:
                                    volumeClaimTemplate:
                                      description: |-
                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.

                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                                If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be

                        Marking an instance as offline results in the following:


                        1. The associated Pod is stopped, and its PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is retained for potential
                           future reuse or data recovery, but it is no longer actively used.
                        2. The ordinal number assigned to this instance is preserved, ensuring it remains unique
                           and avoiding conflicts with new instances.


                        Setting instances to offline allows for a controlled scale-in process, preserving their data and maintaining

                                  for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                  MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                  Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                  be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                  MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                              - `ClusterIP` allocates a Cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
                                 Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified,
                                 they are determined by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects.
                              - `NodePort` builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.
                              - `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
                                 which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.


                              Note: although K8s Service type allows the 'ExternalName' type, it is not a valid option for ClusterComponentService.

                            description: |-
                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                              and deleted when the pod is removed.


                              Use this if:
                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                 tracking are needed,
                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                              of an individual pod.


                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                              more information.


                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                              persistent volumes at the same time.
                            properties:

                                  Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                  to the PVC after it has been created.

                                          dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                          provisioner.
                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.
                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                            in any namespaces.
                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:

                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                            receive on the ClusterIP. If set to "Local", the proxy will assume that pods
                            only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,
                            dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,
                            "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly
                            (possibly modified by topology and other features).

                            changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4"
                            and "IPv6".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,

                            options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                            "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                            to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                            specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                            EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                            allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                            than a virtual IP.
                            "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                            routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                            "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                            as the clusterIP.
                            "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                            Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                  Specifies a list of ClusterSharding objects that manage the sharding topology for Cluster Components.
                  Each ClusterSharding organizes components into shards, with each shard corresponding to a Component.
                  Components within a shard are all based on a common ClusterComponentSpec template, ensuring uniform configurations.


                  This field supports dynamic resharding by facilitating the addition or removal of shards
                  through the `shards` field in ClusterSharding.


                  Note: `shardings` and `componentSpecs` cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a Cluster.

                    ClusterSharding defines how KubeBlocks manage dynamic provisioned shards.
                    A typical design pattern for distributed databases is to distribute data across multiple shards,
                    with each shard consisting of multiple replicas.
                    Therefore, KubeBlocks supports representing a shard with a Component and dynamically instantiating Components
                    using a template when shards are added.
                    When shards are removed, the corresponding Components are also deleted.
                  properties:
                    name:
                      description: |-
                        Represents the common parent part of all shard names.


                        This identifier is included as part of the Service DNS name and must comply with IANA service naming rules.
                        It is used to generate the names of underlying Components following the pattern `$(clusterSharding.name)-$(ShardID)`.
                        ShardID is a random string that is appended to the Name to generate unique identifiers for each shard.
                        For example, if the sharding specification name is "my-shard" and the ShardID is "abc", the resulting Component name
                        would be "my-shard-abc".


                        Note that the name defined in Component template(`clusterSharding.template.name`) will be disregarded
                        when generating the Component names of the shards. The `clusterSharding.name` field takes precedence.

                        Users can declare the desired number of shards through this field.
                        KubeBlocks dynamically creates and deletes Components based on the difference
                        between the desired and actual number of shards.
                        KubeBlocks provides lifecycle management for sharding, including:


                        - Executing the shardProvision Action defined in the ShardingDefinition when the number of shards increases.
                          This allows for custom actions to be performed after a new shard is provisioned.
                        - Executing the shardTerminate Action defined in the ShardingDefinition when the number of shards decreases.
                          This enables custom cleanup or data migration tasks to be executed before a shard is terminated.
                          Resources and data associated with the corresponding Component will also be deleted.

                        definitions for creating and managing the Components.
                        KubeBlocks uses this template to generate a set of identical Components of shards.
                        All the generated Components will have the same specifications and definitions as specified in the `template` field.


                        This allows for the creation of multiple Components with consistent configurations,
                        enabling sharding and distribution of workloads across Components.

                            Allows for the customization of configuration values for each instance within a Component.
                            An instance represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps).
                            While instances typically share a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec,
                            they can require unique settings in various scenarios:


                            For example:
                            - A database Component might require different resource allocations for primary and secondary instances,
                              with primaries needing more resources.
                            - During a rolling upgrade, a Component may first update the image for one or a few instances,
                              and then update the remaining instances after verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly.


                            InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations per instance.
                            Each instance's name is constructed using the pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal),
                            starting with an ordinal of 0.
                            It is crucial to maintain unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts.


                            The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the total number of replicas specified for the Component.
                            Any remaining replicas will be generated using the default template and will follow the default naming rules.

                              InstanceTemplate allows customization of individual replica configurations within a Component,
                              without altering the base component template defined in ClusterComponentSpec.
                              It enables the application of distinct settings to specific instances (replicas),
                              providing flexibility while maintaining a common configuration baseline.

                                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                            If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name.
                                            Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as "1".
                                            Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you can leave the property empty).

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.


                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.


                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.
                                      properties:

                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                    the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                    provisioner.
                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.
                                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                            fsType is the filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
                                            Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                                            Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                            fsType is the filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
                                            Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                                            Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                            Marking an instance as offline results in the following:


                            1. The associated Pod is stopped, and its PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is retained for potential
                               future reuse or data recovery, but it is no longer actively used.
                            2. The ordinal number assigned to this instance is preserved, ensuring it remains unique
                               and avoiding conflicts with new instances.


                            Setting instances to offline allows for a controlled scale-in process, preserving their data and maintaining
                            ordinal consistency within the Cluster.
                            Note that offline instances and their associated resources, such as PVCs, are not automatically deleted.
                            The administrator must manually manage the cleanup and removal of these resources when they are no longer needed.

                                Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes.

                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.


                                      This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                      TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                      and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                      We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                      of pods into each bucket.
                                      We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                      Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                      nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                      e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                      WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                      the spread constraint.
                                      - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                      - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                        but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                        skew.
                                      A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                      if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                      "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                      If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                      to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                      won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                            This ServiceAccount is used to grant necessary permissions for the Component's Pods to interact
                            with other Kubernetes resources, such as modifying Pod labels or sending events.


                            Defaults:
                            To perform certain operational tasks, agent sidecars running in Pods require specific RBAC permissions.
                            The service account will be bound to a default role named "kubeblocks-cluster-pod-role" which is installed together with KubeBlocks.
                            If not specified, KubeBlocks automatically assigns a default ServiceAccount named "kb-{cluster.name}"


                            Future Changes:
                            Future versions might change the default ServiceAccount creation strategy to one per Component,
                            potentially revising the naming to "kb-{cluster.name}-{component.name}".


                            Users can override the automatic ServiceAccount assignment by explicitly setting the name of
                            an existed ServiceAccount in this field.

                            Types of services:


                            - External services: Not managed by KubeBlocks or managed by a different KubeBlocks operator;
                              Require a ServiceDescriptor for connection details.
                            - Services provided by a Cluster: Managed by the same KubeBlocks operator;
                              identified using Cluster, Component and Service names.


                            ServiceRefs with identical `serviceRef.name` in the same Cluster are considered the same.


                            Example:
                            ```yaml
                            serviceRefs:

                            ```
                            The example above includes ServiceRefs to an external Redis Sentinel service and a PostgreSQL Cluster.

                                  `endpoint`, `port`, `username`, and `password`.


                                  Note:


                                  - The `ServiceKind` and `ServiceVersion` specified in the service reference within the
                                    ClusterDefinition are not validated when using this approach.
                                  - If both `cluster` and `serviceDescriptor` are present, `cluster` will take precedence.

                                  - `ClusterIP` allocates a Cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
                                     Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified,
                                     they are determined by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects.
                                  - `NodePort` builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.
                                  - `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
                                     which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.


                                  Note: although K8s Service type allows the 'ExternalName' type, it is not a valid option for ClusterComponentService.

                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                  Use this if:
                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                     tracking are needed,
                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                  of an individual pod.


                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                  more information.


                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                  persistent volumes at the same time.
                                properties:

                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                      manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                              provisioner.
                                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified.
                                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                in any namespaces.
                                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                  It defines how resources, data, and backups associated with a Cluster are managed during termination.
                  Choose a policy based on the desired level of resource cleanup and data preservation:


                  - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
                  - `Delete`: Deletes all runtime resources belong to the Cluster.
                  - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and
                    backups in external storage.
                    This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments
                    to avoid irreversible data loss.


                  Warning: Choosing an inappropriate termination policy can result in data loss.
                  The `WipeOut` policy is particularly risky in production environments due to its irreversible nature.

                  each tailored to different use cases or environments.


                  If `topology` is not specified, the Cluster will use the default topology defined in the ClusterDefinition.


                  Note: Once set during the Cluster creation, the `topology` field cannot be modified.
                  It establishes the initial composition and structure of the Cluster and is intended for one-time configuration.

          Cluster offers a unified management interface for a wide variety of database and storage systems:


          - Relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
          - NoSQL databases: Redis, MongoDB
          - KV stores: ZooKeeper, etcd
          - Analytics systems: ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, ClickHouse, Doris, StarRocks, Solr
          - Message queues: Kafka, Pulsar
          - Distributed SQL: TiDB, OceanBase
          - Vector databases: Qdrant, Milvus, Weaviate
          - Object storage: Minio


          KubeBlocks utilizes an abstraction layer to encapsulate the characteristics of these diverse systems.
          A Cluster is composed of multiple Components, each defined by vendors or KubeBlocks Addon developers via ComponentDefinition,
          arranged in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topologies.
          The topologies, defined in a ClusterDefinition, coordinate reconciliation across Cluster's lifecycle phases:
          Creating, Running, Updating, Stopping, Stopped, Deleting.
          Lifecycle management ensures that each Component operates in harmony, executing appropriate actions at each lifecycle stage.


          For sharded-nothing architecture, the Cluster supports managing multiple shards,
          each shard managed by a separate Component, supporting dynamic resharding.


          The Cluster object is aimed to maintain the overall integrity and availability of a database cluster,
          serves as the central control point, abstracting the complexity of multiple-component management,
          and providing a unified interface for cluster-wide operations.

                      It is a map where the keys are the label keys and the values are the corresponding label values.
                      Pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have all the specified labels with the corresponding values.


                      For example, if NodeLabels is set to {"nodeType": "ssd", "environment": "production"},
                      pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have both the "nodeType" label with value "ssd"

                      - SharedNode: Allow that multiple Pods may share the same node, which is the default behavior of K8s.
                      - DedicatedNode: Each Pod runs on a dedicated node, ensuring that no two Pods share the same node.
                        In other words, if a Pod is already running on a node, no other Pods will be scheduled on that node.
                        Which provides a higher level of isolation and resource guarantee for Pods.


                       The default value is `SharedNode`.
                    enum:
                    - SharedNode

                      Represents the key of node labels used to define the topology domain for Pod anti-affinity
                      and Pod spread constraints.


                      In K8s, a topology domain is a set of nodes that have the same value for a specific label key.
                      Nodes with labels containing any of the specified TopologyKeys and identical values are considered
                      to be in the same topology domain.


                      Note: The concept of topology in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the concept of
                      topology in the ClusterDefinition.


                      When a Pod has anti-affinity or spread constraints specified, Kubernetes will attempt to schedule the
                      Pod on nodes with different values for the specified TopologyKeys.
                      This ensures that Pods are spread across different topology domains, promoting high availability and
                      reducing the impact of node failures.


                      Some well-known label keys, such as `kubernetes.io/hostname` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`,
                      are often used as TopologyKey.
                      These keys represent the hostname and zone of a node, respectively.
                      By including these keys in the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread across nodes with
                      different hostnames or zones.


                      In addition to the well-known keys, users can also specify custom label keys as TopologyKeys.
                      This allows for more flexible and custom topology definitions based on the specific needs
                      of the application or environment.


                      The TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each string represents a label key.

                            Pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have all the specified labels with the corresponding values.


                            For example, if NodeLabels is set to {"nodeType": "ssd", "environment": "production"},
                            pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have both the "nodeType" label with value "ssd"

                            - SharedNode: Allow that multiple Pods may share the same node, which is the default behavior of K8s.
                            - DedicatedNode: Each Pod runs on a dedicated node, ensuring that no two Pods share the same node.
                              In other words, if a Pod is already running on a node, no other Pods will be scheduled on that node.
                              Which provides a higher level of isolation and resource guarantee for Pods.


                             The default value is `SharedNode`.
                          enum:

                            Represents the key of node labels used to define the topology domain for Pod anti-affinity
                            and Pod spread constraints.


                            In K8s, a topology domain is a set of nodes that have the same value for a specific label key.
                            Nodes with labels containing any of the specified TopologyKeys and identical values are considered
                            to be in the same topology domain.


                            Note: The concept of topology in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the concept of
                            topology in the ClusterDefinition.


                            When a Pod has anti-affinity or spread constraints specified, Kubernetes will attempt to schedule the
                            Pod on nodes with different values for the specified TopologyKeys.
                            This ensures that Pods are spread across different topology domains, promoting high availability and
                            reducing the impact of node failures.


                            Some well-known label keys, such as `kubernetes.io/hostname` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`,
                            are often used as TopologyKey.
                            These keys represent the hostname and zone of a node, respectively.
                            By including these keys in the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread across nodes with
                            different hostnames or zones.


                            In addition to the well-known keys, users can also specify custom label keys as TopologyKeys.
                            This allows for more flexible and custom topology definitions based on the specific needs
                            of the application or environment.


                            The TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each string represents a label key.
                            The order of the keys in the slice does not matter.

                        An instance represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps).
                        While instances typically share a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec,
                        they can require unique settings in various scenarios:


                        For example:
                        - A database Component might require different resource allocations for primary and secondary instances,
                          with primaries needing more resources.
                        - During a rolling upgrade, a Component may first update the image for one or a few instances,
                          and then update the remaining instances after verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly.


                        InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations per instance.
                        Each instance's name is constructed using the pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal),
                        starting with an ordinal of 0.
                        It is crucial to maintain unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts.


                        The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the total number of replicas specified for the Component.
                        Any remaining replicas will be generated using the default template and will follow the default naming rules.

                                  Each toleration in the array allows the Pod to tolerate node taints based on
                                  specified `key`, `value`, `effect`, and `operator`.


                                  - The `key`, `value`, and `effect` identify the taint that the toleration matches.
                                  - The `operator` determines how the toleration matches the taint.


                                  Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes.

                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:

                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:

                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                        WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                        the spread constraint.
                                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                  description: |-
                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.


                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.


                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:
                                    volumeClaimTemplate:
                                      description: |-
                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                                If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be

                        Marking an instance as offline results in the following:


                        1. The associated Pod is stopped, and its PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is retained for potential
                           future reuse or data recovery, but it is no longer actively used.
                        2. The ordinal number assigned to this instance is preserved, ensuring it remains unique
                           and avoiding conflicts with new instances.


                        Setting instances to offline allows for a controlled scale-in process, preserving their data and maintaining
                        ordinal consistency within the Cluster.
                        Note that offline instances and their associated resources, such as PVCs, are not automatically deleted.
                        The administrator must manually manage the cleanup and removal of these resources when they are no longer needed.

                                  MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                        Users can override the automatic ServiceAccount assignment by explicitly setting the name of
                        an existed ServiceAccount in this field.

                      description: |-
                        Defines a list of ServiceRef for a Component, enabling access to both external services and
                        Services provided by other Clusters.


                        Types of services:


                        - External services: Not managed by KubeBlocks or managed by a different KubeBlocks operator;
                          Require a ServiceDescriptor for connection details.
                        - Services provided by a Cluster: Managed by the same KubeBlocks operator;
                          identified using Cluster, Component and Service names.


                        ServiceRefs with identical `serviceRef.name` in the same Cluster are considered the same.


                        Example:
                        ```yaml
                        serviceRefs:
                          - name: "redis-sentinel"
                            serviceDescriptor:
                              name: "external-redis-sentinel"
                          - name: "postgres-cluster"
                            clusterServiceSelector:
                              cluster: "my-postgres-cluster"
                              service:
                                component: "postgresql"
                        ```
                        The example above includes ServiceRefs to an external Redis Sentinel service and a PostgreSQL Cluster.

                              Specifies the name of the KubeBlocks Cluster being referenced.
                              This is used when services from another KubeBlocks Cluster are consumed.


                              By default, the referenced KubeBlocks Cluster's `clusterDefinition.spec.connectionCredential`
                              will be utilized to bind to the current Component. This credential should include:
                              `endpoint`, `port`, `username`, and `password`.


                              Note:


                              - The `ServiceKind` and `ServiceVersion` specified in the service reference within the
                                ClusterDefinition are not validated when using this approach.
                              - If both `cluster` and `serviceDescriptor` are present, `cluster` will take precedence.


                              Deprecated since v0.9 since `clusterDefinition.spec.connectionCredential` is deprecated,
                              use `clusterServiceSelector` instead.

                                 they are determined by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects.
                              - `NodePort` builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.
                              - `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
                                 which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.


                              Note: although K8s Service type allows the 'ExternalName' type, it is not a valid option for ClusterComponentService.

                        A boolean flag that indicates whether the Component should use Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                        for secure communication.
                        When set to true, the Component will be configured to use TLS encryption for its network connections.
                        This ensures that the data transmitted between the Component and its clients or other Components is encrypted
                        and protected from unauthorized access.
                        If TLS is enabled, the Component may require additional configuration, such as specifying TLS certificates and keys,
                        to properly set up the secure communication channel.

                      description: |-
                        Allows Pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.
                        Each toleration in the array allows the Pod to tolerate node taints based on
                        specified `key`, `value`, `effect`, and `operator`.


                        - The `key`, `value`, and `effect` identify the taint that the toleration matches.
                        - The `operator` determines how the toleration matches the taint.


                        Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes.

                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                              and deleted when the pod is removed.


                              Use this if:
                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                 tracking are needed,
                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                              of an individual pod.


                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                              more information.


                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                              persistent volumes at the same time.

                                  Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.

                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                            It's a required field.

                  Specifies a list of ShardingSpec objects that manage the sharding topology for Cluster Components.
                  Each ShardingSpec organizes components into shards, with each shard corresponding to a Component.
                  Components within a shard are all based on a common ClusterComponentSpec template, ensuring uniform configurations.


                  This field supports dynamic resharding by facilitating the addition or removal of shards
                  through the `shards` field in ShardingSpec.


                  Note: `shardingSpecs` and `componentSpecs` cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a Cluster.

                    ShardingSpec defines how KubeBlocks manage dynamic provisioned shards.
                    A typical design pattern for distributed databases is to distribute data across multiple shards,
                    with each shard consisting of multiple replicas.
                    Therefore, KubeBlocks supports representing a shard with a Component and dynamically instantiating Components
                    using a template when shards are added.
                    When shards are removed, the corresponding Components are also deleted.

                        Represents the common parent part of all shard names.
                        This identifier is included as part of the Service DNS name and must comply with IANA service naming rules.
                        It is used to generate the names of underlying Components following the pattern `$(shardingSpec.name)-$(ShardID)`.
                        ShardID is a random string that is appended to the Name to generate unique identifiers for each shard.
                        For example, if the sharding specification name is "my-shard" and the ShardID is "abc", the resulting Component name
                        would be "my-shard-abc".


                        Note that the name defined in Component template(`shardingSpec.template.name`) will be disregarded
                        when generating the Component names of the shards. The `shardingSpec.name` field takes precedence.

                        KubeBlocks dynamically creates and deletes Components based on the difference
                        between the desired and actual number of shards.
                        KubeBlocks provides lifecycle management for sharding, including:


                        - Executing the postProvision Action defined in the ComponentDefinition when the number of shards increases.
                          This allows for custom actions to be performed after a new shard is provisioned.
                        - Executing the preTerminate Action defined in the ComponentDefinition when the number of shards decreases.
                          This enables custom cleanup or data migration tasks to be executed before a shard is terminated.
                          Resources and data associated with the corresponding Component will also be deleted.

                        KubeBlocks uses this template to generate a set of identical Components or shards.
                        All the generated Components will have the same specifications and definitions as specified in the `template` field.


                        This allows for the creation of multiple Components with consistent configurations,
                        enabling sharding and distribution of workloads across Components.

                                Pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have all the specified labels with the corresponding values.


                                For example, if NodeLabels is set to {"nodeType": "ssd", "environment": "production"},
                                pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have both the "nodeType" label with value "ssd"

                                This field allows users to control Pod placement based on specific node labels.
                                It can be used to ensure that Pods are scheduled on nodes with certain characteristics,

                                - SharedNode: Allow that multiple Pods may share the same node, which is the default behavior of K8s.
                                - DedicatedNode: Each Pod runs on a dedicated node, ensuring that no two Pods share the same node.
                                  In other words, if a Pod is already running on a node, no other Pods will be scheduled on that node.
                                  Which provides a higher level of isolation and resource guarantee for Pods.


                                 The default value is `SharedNode`.
                              enum:

                                Represents the key of node labels used to define the topology domain for Pod anti-affinity
                                and Pod spread constraints.


                                In K8s, a topology domain is a set of nodes that have the same value for a specific label key.
                                Nodes with labels containing any of the specified TopologyKeys and identical values are considered
                                to be in the same topology domain.


                                Note: The concept of topology in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the concept of
                                topology in the ClusterDefinition.


                                When a Pod has anti-affinity or spread constraints specified, Kubernetes will attempt to schedule the
                                Pod on nodes with different values for the specified TopologyKeys.
                                This ensures that Pods are spread across different topology domains, promoting high availability and
                                reducing the impact of node failures.


                                Some well-known label keys, such as `kubernetes.io/hostname` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`,
                                are often used as TopologyKey.
                                These keys represent the hostname and zone of a node, respectively.
                                By including these keys in the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread across nodes with
                                different hostnames or zones.


                                In addition to the well-known keys, users can also specify custom label keys as TopologyKeys.
                                This allows for more flexible and custom topology definitions based on the specific needs
                                of the application or environment.


                                The TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each string represents a label key.
                                The order of the keys in the slice does not matter.

                            Allows for the customization of configuration values for each instance within a Component.
                            An instance represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps).
                            While instances typically share a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec,
                            they can require unique settings in various scenarios:


                            For example:
                            - A database Component might require different resource allocations for primary and secondary instances,
                              with primaries needing more resources.
                            - During a rolling upgrade, a Component may first update the image for one or a few instances,
                              and then update the remaining instances after verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly.


                            InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations per instance.
                            Each instance's name is constructed using the pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal),
                            starting with an ordinal of 0.
                            It is crucial to maintain unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts.


                            The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the total number of replicas specified for the Component.
                            Any remaining replicas will be generated using the default template and will follow the default naming rules.

                                      Each toleration in the array allows the Pod to tolerate node taints based on
                                      specified `key`, `value`, `effect`, and `operator`.


                                      - The `key`, `value`, and `effect` identify the taint that the toleration matches.
                                      - The `operator` determines how the toleration matches the taint.


                                      Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes.

                                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                            it will violate MaxSkew.


                                            This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                            TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                            and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                            of pods into each bucket.
                                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of

                                            - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                            - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                              but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                              skew.
                                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                            "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:

                                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.


                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.


                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.
                                      properties:
                                        volumeClaimTemplate:
                                          description: |-
                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.
                                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            If set to true, the following annotations will be patched into the Service:

                            These annotations allow the Prometheus installed by KubeBlocks to discover and scrape metrics from the exporter.

                            Marking an instance as offline results in the following:


                            1. The associated Pod is stopped, and its PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is retained for potential
                               future reuse or data recovery, but it is no longer actively used.
                            2. The ordinal number assigned to this instance is preserved, ensuring it remains unique
                               and avoiding conflicts with new instances.


                            Setting instances to offline allows for a controlled scale-in process, preserving their data and maintaining
                            ordinal consistency within the Cluster.
                            Note that offline instances and their associated resources, such as PVCs, are not automatically deleted.
                            The administrator must manually manage the cleanup and removal of these resources when they are no longer needed.

                                                  MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                  be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`

                                                  pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                      MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.

                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                                      MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                            an existed ServiceAccount in this field.

                            Defines a list of ServiceRef for a Component, enabling access to both external services and
                            Services provided by other Clusters.


                            Types of services:


                            - External services: Not managed by KubeBlocks or managed by a different KubeBlocks operator;
                              Require a ServiceDescriptor for connection details.
                            - Services provided by a Cluster: Managed by the same KubeBlocks operator;
                              identified using Cluster, Component and Service names.


                            ServiceRefs with identical `serviceRef.name` in the same Cluster are considered the same.


                            Example:
                            ```yaml
                            serviceRefs:
                              - name: "redis-sentinel"
                                serviceDescriptor:
                                  name: "external-redis-sentinel"
                              - name: "postgres-cluster"
                                clusterServiceSelector:
                                  cluster: "my-postgres-cluster"
                                  service:
                                    component: "postgresql"
                            ```
                            The example above includes ServiceRefs to an external Redis Sentinel service and a PostgreSQL Cluster.

                                  This is used when services from another KubeBlocks Cluster are consumed.


                                  By default, the referenced KubeBlocks Cluster's `clusterDefinition.spec.connectionCredential`
                                  will be utilized to bind to the current Component. This credential should include:
                                  `endpoint`, `port`, `username`, and `password`.


                                  Note:


                                  - The `ServiceKind` and `ServiceVersion` specified in the service reference within the
                                    ClusterDefinition are not validated when using this approach.
                                  - If both `cluster` and `serviceDescriptor` are present, `cluster` will take precedence.

                                  - `ClusterIP` allocates a Cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
                                     Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified,
                                     they are determined by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects.
                                  - `NodePort` builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.
                                  - `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
                                     which routes to the same endpoints as the ClusterIP.


                                  Note: although K8s Service type allows the 'ExternalName' type, it is not a valid option for ClusterComponentService.

                            When set to true, the Component will be configured to use TLS encryption for its network connections.

                            Each toleration in the array allows the Pod to tolerate node taints based on
                            specified `key`, `value`, `effect`, and `operator`.


                            - The `key`, `value`, and `effect` identify the taint that the toleration matches.
                            - The `operator` determines how the toleration matches the taint.


                            Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes.

                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                  Use this if:
                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                     tracking are needed,
                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                  of an individual pod.


                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                  more information.


                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                  persistent volumes at the same time.
                                properties:

                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is

                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                      manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                              provisioner.
                                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified.
                                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                in any namespaces.
                                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                  Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
                  It defines how resources, data, and backups associated with a Cluster are managed during termination.
                  Choose a policy based on the desired level of resource cleanup and data preservation:


                  - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
                  - `Halt`: Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs),
                    allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations.
                     Warning: Halt policy is deprecated in 0.9.1 and will have same meaning as DoNotTerminate.
                  - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while
                    removing all persistent data.
                  - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and
                    backups in external storage.
                    This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments
                    to avoid irreversible data loss.


                  Warning: Choosing an inappropriate termination policy can result in data loss.
                  The `WipeOut` policy is particularly risky in production environments due to its irreversible nature.

                    The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                    the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

                    effect:
                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                  Specifies the name of the ClusterTopology to be used when creating the Cluster.


                  This field defines which set of Components, as outlined in the ClusterDefinition, will be used to
                  construct the Cluster based on the named topology.
                  The ClusterDefinition may list multiple topologies under `clusterdefinition.spec.topologies[*]`,
                  each tailored to different use cases or environments.


                  If `topology` is not specified, the Cluster will use the default topology defined in the ClusterDefinition.


                  Note: Once set during the Cluster creation, the `topology` field cannot be modified.
                  It establishes the initial composition and structure of the Cluster and is intended for one-time configuration.
