                      \n In K8s, a topology domain is a set of nodes that have the
                      same value for a specific label key. Nodes with labels containing
                      any of the specified TopologyKeys and identical values are considered
                      to be in the same topology domain. \n Note: The concept of topology
                      in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the concept
                      of topology in the ClusterDefinition. \n When a Pod has anti-affinity
                      or spread constraints specified, Kubernetes will attempt to
                      schedule the Pod on nodes with different values for the specified
                      TopologyKeys. This ensures that Pods are spread across different
                      topology domains, promoting high availability and reducing the
                      impact of node failures. \n Some well-known label keys, such
                      as `kubernetes.io/hostname` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`,
                      are often used as TopologyKey. These keys represent the hostname
                      and zone of a node, respectively. By including these keys in
                      the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread across nodes with
                      different hostnames or zones. \n In addition to the well-known
                      keys, users can also specify custom label keys as TopologyKeys.
                      This allows for more flexible and custom topology definitions
                      based on the specific needs of the application or environment.
                      \n The TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each
                      string represents a label key. The order of the keys in the

                            key. Nodes with labels containing any of the specified
                            TopologyKeys and identical values are considered to be
                            in the same topology domain. \n Note: The concept of topology
                            in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the
                            concept of topology in the ClusterDefinition. \n When
                            a Pod has anti-affinity or spread constraints specified,
                            Kubernetes will attempt to schedule the Pod on nodes with
                            different values for the specified TopologyKeys. This
                            ensures that Pods are spread across different topology
                            domains, promoting high availability and reducing the
                            impact of node failures. \n Some well-known label keys,
                            such as `kubernetes.io/hostname` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`,
                            are often used as TopologyKey. These keys represent the
                            hostname and zone of a node, respectively. By including
                            these keys in the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread
                            across nodes with different hostnames or zones. \n In
                            addition to the well-known keys, users can also specify
                            custom label keys as TopologyKeys. This allows for more
                            flexible and custom topology definitions based on the
                            specific needs of the application or environment. \n The
                            TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each string
                            represents a label key. The order of the keys in the slice
                            does not matter."

                        Services, and ConfigMaps). While instances typically share
                        a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec,
                        they can require unique settings in various scenarios: \n
                        For example: - A database component might require different
                        resource allocations for primary and secondary instances,
                        with primaries needing more resources. - During a rolling
                        upgrade, a component may first update the image for one or
                        a few instances, and then update the remaining instances after
                        verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly.
                        \n InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations
                        per instance. Each instance's name is constructed using the
                        pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal), starting
                        with an ordinal of 0. It is crucial to maintain unique names
                        for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts. \n The sum of
                        replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the
                        total number of Replicas specified for the Component. Any
                        remaining replicas will be generated using the default template
                        and will follow the default naming rules."

                                                as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                                values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates
                                                an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified. * While dataSource only

                            represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources
                            like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps). While instances
                            typically share a common configuration as defined in the
                            ClusterComponentSpec, they can require unique settings
                            in various scenarios: \n For example: - A database component
                            might require different resource allocations for primary
                            and secondary instances, with primaries needing more resources.
                            - During a rolling upgrade, a component may first update
                            the image for one or a few instances, and then update
                            the remaining instances after verifying that the updated
                            instances are functioning correctly. \n InstanceTemplate
                            allows for specifying these unique configurations per
                            instance. Each instance's name is constructed using the
                            pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal),
                            starting with an ordinal of 0. It is crucial to maintain
                            unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts.
                            \n The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should
                            not exceed the total number of Replicas specified for
                            the Component. Any remaining replicas will be generated
                            using the default template and will follow the default
                            naming rules."

                                        that defines it - it will be created before
                                        the pod starts, and deleted when the pod is
                                        removed. \n Use this if: a) the volume is
                                        only needed while the pod runs, b) features
                                        of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot
                                        or capacity tracking are needed, c) the storage
                                        driver is specified through a storage class,
                                        and d) the storage driver supports dynamic
                                        volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more information
                                        on the connection between this volume type
                                        and PersistentVolumeClaim). \n Use PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes
                                        that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod. \n Use CSI for light-weight
                                        local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver
                                        is meant to be used that way - see the documentation
                                        of the driver for more information. \n A pod
                                        can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time."

                                            then blocked until the unrelated PVC is
                                            removed. If such a pre-created PVC is

                                                    they must have the same value.
                                                    For backwards compatibility, when
                                                    namespace isn''t specified in
                                                    dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set
                                                    to the same value automatically
                                                    if one of them is empty and the
                                                    other is non-empty. When namespace
                                                    is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn''t set to the same
                                                    value and must be empty. There
                                                    are three important differences
                                                    between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows
                                                    two specific types of objects,
                                                    dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                                    objects. * While dataSource ignores
                                                    disallowed values (dropping them),
                                                    dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                                    and generates an error if a disallowed
                                                    value is specified. * While dataSource
                                                    only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows objects in any namespaces.

                                            Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is
                                            supported by the host operating system.
                                            Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly
                                            inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                            be services outside KubeBlocks or non-Kubernetes services.
                            - Connection requires a ServiceDescriptor providing details

                            within the same KubeBlocks environment. - Service binding
                            is achieved by specifying cluster names in the service
                            references, with configurations handled by the KubeBlocks
