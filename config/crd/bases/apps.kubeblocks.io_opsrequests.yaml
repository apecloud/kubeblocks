                              a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to
                              endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector
                              or if that is not specified, by manual construction
                              of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If
                              clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and
                              the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and
                              allocates a port on every node which routes to the same
                              endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on
                              NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported
                              in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases this service
                              to the specified externalName. Several other fields
                              do not apply to ExternalName services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types'

                          identifier. Being a type captures intent and helps make
                          sure that the node name is not confused with similar concepts
                          (the hostname, the cloud provider id, the cloud provider
                          name etc) \n To clarify the various types: \n - Node.Name
                          is the Name field of the Node in the API.  This should be
                          stored in a NodeName. Unfortunately, because Name is part
                          of ObjectMeta, we can't store it as a NodeName at the API
                          level. \n - Hostname is the hostname of the local machine
                          (from uname -n). However, some components allow the user
                          to pass in a --hostname-override flag, which will override
                          this in most places. In the absence of anything more meaningful,
                          kubelet will use Hostname as the Node.Name when it creates
                          the Node. \n * The cloudproviders have the own names: GCE
                          has InstanceName, AWS has InstanceId. \n For GCE, InstanceName
                          is the Name of an Instance object in the GCE API.  On GCE,
                          Instance.Name becomes the Hostname, and thus it makes sense
                          also to use it as the Node.Name.  But that is GCE specific,
                          and it is up to the cloudprovider how to do this mapping.
                          \n For AWS, the InstanceID is not yet suitable for use as
                          a Node.Name, so we actually use the PrivateDnsName for the
                          Node.Name.  And this is _not_ always the same as the hostname:
                          if we are using a custom DHCP domain it won't be."
