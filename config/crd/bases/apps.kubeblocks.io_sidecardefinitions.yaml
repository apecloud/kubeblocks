                        YAML supports both octal and decimal values for file permissions.


                        Please note that this setting only affects the permissions of the files themselves.
                        Directories within the specified path are not impacted by this setting.
                        It's important to be aware that this setting might conflict with other options
                        that influence the file mode, such as fsGroup.
                        In such cases, the resulting file mode may have additional bits set.

                            The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                            a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                            Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                            If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                            value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                            Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                            the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                            This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                      description: |-
                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                        completed.

                        The expression will only be evaluated if the var is successfully resolved to a non-credential value.


                        The resolved value can be accessed by its name within the expression, system vars and other user-defined
                        non-credential vars can be used within the expression in the same way.
                        Notice that, when accessing vars by its name, you should replace all the "-" in the name with "_", because of
                        that "-" is not a valid identifier in Go.


                        All expressions are evaluated in the order the vars are defined. If a var depends on any vars that also
                        have expressions defined, be careful about the evaluation order as it may use intermediate values.


                        The result of evaluation will be used as the final value of the var. If the expression fails to evaluate,
                        the resolving of var will also be considered failed.
