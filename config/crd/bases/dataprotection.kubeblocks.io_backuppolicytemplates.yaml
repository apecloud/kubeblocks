                      - If no replica with the specified role exists, the backup task will fail.
                        Special case: If there is only one replica in the cluster, it will be used for backup,
                        even if its role differs from the specified one.
                        For example, if you specify backing up on a secondary replica, but the cluster is single-node
                        with only one primary replica, the primary will be used for backup.
                        Future versions will address this special case using role priorities.
                      - If multiple replicas satisfy the specified role, the choice (`Any` or `All`) will be made according to
                        the `strategy` field below.
