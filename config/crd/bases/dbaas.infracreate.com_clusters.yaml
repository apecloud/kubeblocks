                        to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or
                        if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints

                                  objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the
