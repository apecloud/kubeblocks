description: ApeCloud MySQL is fully compatible with MySQL syntax and supports single-availability
  zone deployment, double-availability zone deployment, and multiple-availability zone deployment.
  Based on the Paxos consensus protocol, ApeCloud MySQL realizes automatic leader election, log
  synchronization, and strict consistency. ApeCloud MySQL is the optimum choice for the production
  environment since it can automatically perform a high-availability switch to maintain business continuity
  when container exceptions, server exceptions, or availability zone exceptions occur.
