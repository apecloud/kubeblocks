description: ApeCloud MySQL is fully compatible with MySQL syntax and supports single-availability
  zone deployment, double-availability zone deployment, and multiple-availability zone deployment.
  Based on the Paxos consensus protocol, ApeCloud MySQL realizes automatic leader election, log
  synchronization, and strict consistency. ApeCloud MySQL is the optimum choice for the production
  environment since it can automatically perform a high-availability switch to maintain business continuity
  when container exceptions, server exceptions, or availability zone exceptions occur.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.8

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
