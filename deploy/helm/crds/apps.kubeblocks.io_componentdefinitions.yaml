          ComponentDefinition serves as a reusable blueprint for creating Components,
          encapsulating essential static settings such as Component description,
          Pod templates, configuration file templates, scripts, parameter lists,
          injected environment variables and their sources, and event handlers.
          ComponentDefinition works in conjunction with dynamic settings from the ClusterComponentSpec,
          to instantiate Components during Cluster creation.


          Key aspects that can be defined in a ComponentDefinition include:


          - PodSpec template: Specifies the PodSpec template used by the Component.
          - Configuration templates: Specify the configuration file templates required by the Component.
          - Scripts: Provide the necessary scripts for Component management and operations.
          - Storage volumes: Specify the storage volumes and their configurations for the Component.
          - Pod roles: Outlines various roles of Pods within the Component along with their capabilities.
          - Exposed Kubernetes Services: Specify the Services that need to be exposed by the Component.
          - System accounts: Define the system accounts required for the Component.
          - Monitoring and logging: Configure the exporter and logging settings for the Component.


          ComponentDefinitions also enable defining reactive behaviors of the Component in response to events,
          such as member join/leave, Component addition/deletion, role changes, switch over, and more.
          This allows for automatic event handling, thus encapsulating complex behaviors within the Component.


          Referencing a ComponentDefinition when creating individual Components ensures inheritance of predefined configurations,
          promoting reusability and consistency across different deployments and cluster topologies.

                  Each template is represented as a ConfigMap and may contain multiple configuration files,
                  with each file being a key in the ConfigMap.


                  The rendered configuration files will be mounted into the Component's containers

                        or as a decimal value between 0 and 511 (inclusive).
                        YAML supports both octal and decimal values for file permissions.


                        Please note that this setting only affects the permissions of the files themselves.
                        Directories within the specified path are not impacted by this setting.
                        It's important to be aware that this setting might conflict with other options
                        that influence the file mode, such as fsGroup.

                  When `hostNetwork` option is enabled, the Pods share the host's network namespace and can directly access
                  the host's network interfaces.
                  This means that if multiple Pods need to use the same port, they cannot run on the same host simultaneously
                  due to port conflicts.


                  The DNSPolicy field in the Pod spec determines how containers within the Pod perform DNS resolution.
                  When using hostNetwork, the operator will set the DNSPolicy to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.
                  With this policy, DNS queries will first go through the K8s cluster's DNS service.
                  If the query fails, it will fall back to the host's DNS settings.


                  If set, the DNS policy will be automatically set to "ClusterFirstWithHostNet".

                description: |-
                  Defines a set of hooks and procedures that customize the behavior of a Component throughout its lifecycle.
                  Actions are triggered at specific lifecycle stages:


                    - `postProvision`: Defines the hook to be executed after the creation of a Component,
                      with `preCondition` specifying when the action should be fired relative to the Component's lifecycle stages:
                      `Immediately`, `RuntimeReady`, `ComponentReady`, and `ClusterReady`.
                    - `preTerminate`: Defines the hook to be executed before terminating a Component.
                    - `roleProbe`: Defines the procedure which is invoked regularly to assess the role of replicas.
                    - `switchover`: Defines the procedure for a controlled transition of leadership from the current leader to a new replica.
                      This approach aims to minimize downtime and maintain availability in systems with a leader-follower topology,
                      such as before planned maintenance or upgrades on the current leader node.
                    - `memberJoin`: Defines the procedure to add a new replica to the replication group.
                    - `memberLeave`: Defines the method to remove a replica from the replication group.
                    - `readOnly`: Defines the procedure to switch a replica into the read-only state.
                    - `readWrite`: transition a replica from the read-only state back to the read-write state.
                    - `dataDump`: Defines the procedure to export the data from a replica.
                    - `dataLoad`: Defines the procedure to import data into a replica.
                    - `reconfigure`: Defines the procedure that update a replica with new configuration file.
                    - `accountProvision`: Defines the procedure to generate a new database account.

                      The container executing this action has access to following variables:


                      - KB_ACCOUNT_NAME: The name of the system account to be created.
                      - KB_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD: The password for the system account.  // TODO: how to pass the password securely?

                              The impact of this field depends on the `targetPodSelector` value:


                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Any` or `All`, this field will be ignored.
                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.


                              If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod
                              to be removed or added; or a random pod if the Action is triggered at the component level, such as
                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          Currently, this is only applicable to the `postProvision` action.


                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      Defines the procedure for exporting the data from a replica.


                      Use Case:
                      This action is intended for initializing a newly created replica with data. It involves exporting data
                      from an existing replica and importing it into the new, empty replica. This is essential for synchronizing
                      the state of replicas across the system.


                      Applicability:
                      Some database engines or associated sidecar applications (e.g., Patroni) may already provide this functionality.
                      In such cases, this action may not be required.


                      The output should be a valid data dump streamed to stdout. It must exclude any irrelevant information to ensure
                      that only the necessary data is exported for import into the new replica.

                              Commands are executed directly without a shell environment, meaning shell-specific syntax ('|', etc.) is not supported.
                              If the shell is required, it must be explicitly invoked in the command.


                              A successful execution is indicated by an exit status of 0; any non-zero status signifies a failure.

                              This allows the action to utilize the specified container's resources without executing within it.


                              The name must match one of the containers defined in `componentDefinition.spec.runtime`.


                              The resources that can be shared are included:

                              If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod

                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      Use Case:
                      This action is intended for initializing a newly created replica with data. It involves exporting data
                      from an existing replica and importing it into the new, empty replica. This is essential for synchronizing
                      the state of replicas across the system.


                      Some database engines or associated sidecar applications (e.g., Patroni) may already provide this functionality.
                      In such cases, this action may not be required.


                      Data should be received through stdin. If any error occurs during the process,
                      the action must be able to guarantee idempotence to allow for retries from the beginning.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              The working directory for this command is the container's root directory('/').
                              Commands are executed directly without a shell environment, meaning shell-specific syntax ('|', etc.) is not supported.
                              If the shell is required, it must be explicitly invoked in the command.


                              A successful execution is indicated by an exit status of 0; any non-zero status signifies a failure.

                              The name must match one of the containers defined in `componentDefinition.spec.runtime`.


                              The resources that can be shared are included:

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.

                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.

                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                                will be selected for the Action.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      Use Case:
                      This action is used to bring back a replica that was previously in a read-only state,
                      which restricted write operations, to its normal operational state where it can handle
                      both read and write operations.


                      The container executing this action has access to following environment variables:


                      - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the replica pod whose role is being checked.


                      Expected action output:
                      - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed.

                              A successful execution is indicated by an exit status of 0; any non-zero status signifies a failure.

                              The name must match one of the containers defined in `componentDefinition.spec.runtime`.

                              to be removed or added; or a random pod if the Action is triggered at the component level, such as
                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.


                              If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod
                              to be removed or added; or a random pod if the Action is triggered at the component level, such as
                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                    description: |-
                      Defines the procedure which is invoked regularly to assess the role of replicas.


                      This action is periodically triggered at the specified interval to determine the role of each replica.
                      Upon successful execution, the action's output designates the role of the replica,
                      which should match one of the predefined role names within `componentDefinition.spec.roles`.
                      The output is then compared with the previous successful execution result.
                      If a role change is detected, an event is generated to inform the controller,
                      which initiates an update of the replica's role.


                      Defining a RoleProbe Action for a Component is required if roles are defined for the Component.
                      It ensures replicas are correctly labeled with their respective roles.
                      Without this, services that rely on roleSelectors might improperly direct traffic to wrong replicas.


                      The container executing this action has access to following variables:


                      - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the Pod whose role is being assessed.


                      Expected output of this action:
                      - On Success: The determined role of the replica, which must align with one of the roles specified
                        in the component definition.
                      - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed.

                              This allows the action to utilize the specified container's resources without executing within it.


                              The name must match one of the containers defined in `componentDefinition.spec.runtime`.


                              The resources that can be shared are included:

                              Used in conjunction with the `targetPodSelector` field to refine the selection of target pod(s) for Action execution.
                              The impact of this field depends on the `targetPodSelector` value:


                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Any` or `All`, this field will be ignored.
                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.


                              If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod

                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                  These logs can be collected for further analysis and monitoring.


                  The `logConfigs` field is an optional list of LogConfig objects, where each object represents
                  a specific log type and its configuration.
                  It allows you to specify multiple log types and their respective file paths for the Component.

                  needed by the Component to operate within a namespace.
                  These policy rules determine the permissions and verbs the Component is allowed to perform on
                  Kubernetes resources within the namespace.


                  The purpose of this field is to automatically generate the necessary RBAC roles
                  for the Component based on the specified policy rules.
                  This ensures that the Pods in the Component has appropriate permissions to function.

                  Enumerate all possible roles assigned to each replica of the Component, influencing its behavior.


                  A replica can have zero to multiple roles.
                  KubeBlocks operator determines the roles of each replica by invoking the `lifecycleActions.roleProbe` method.
                  This action returns a list of roles for each replica, and the returned roles must be predefined in the `roles` field.


                  The roles assigned to a replica can influence various aspects of the Component's behavior, such as:


                  - Service selection: The Component's exposed Services may target replicas based on their roles using `roleSelector`.
                  - Update order: The roles can determine the order in which replicas are updated during a Component update.
                    For instance, replicas with a "follower" role can be updated first, while the replica with the "leader"
                    role is updated last. This helps minimize the number of leader changes during the update process.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                        An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                        user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                        scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                        removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                        Pod to exceed its resource allocation.


                        To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                        Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                      init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according

                      The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling

                      of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers

                            Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable

                            to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                              skew.
                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.


                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.


                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.


                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.


                                This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                to the PVC after it has been created.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.
                                        If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
                                        in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
                                        it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                                        will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                                        If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                        will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                        If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                        set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                        exists.

                                      ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field
                                      of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.


                                      Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.


                                      ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                                      combination of signer name and a label selector.


                                      Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                      into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                      comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                      The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                      may change the order over time.

              serviceKind:
                description: |-
                  Defines the type of well-known service protocol that the Component provides.
                  It specifies the standard or widely recognized protocol used by the Component to offer its Services.


                  The `serviceKind` field allows users to quickly identify the type of Service provided by the Component
                  based on common protocols or service types. This information helps in understanding the compatibility,
                  interoperability, and usage of the Component within a system.


                  Some examples of well-known service protocols include:


                  - "MySQL": Indicates that the Component provides a MySQL database service.
                  - "PostgreSQL": Indicates that the Component offers a PostgreSQL database service.
                  - "Redis": Signifies that the Component functions as a Redis key-value store.
                  - "ETCD": Denotes that the Component serves as an ETCD distributed key-value store.


                  The `serviceKind` value is case-insensitive, allowing for flexibility in specifying the protocol name.


                  When specifying the `serviceKind`, consider the following guidelines:


                  - Use well-established and widely recognized protocol names or service types.
                  - Ensure that the `serviceKind` accurately represents the primary service type offered by the Component.
                  - If the Component provides multiple services, choose the most prominent or commonly used protocol.
                  - Limit the `serviceKind` to a maximum of 32 characters for conciseness and readability.


                  Note: The `serviceKind` field is optional and can be left empty if the Component does not fit into a well-known
                  service category or if the protocol is not widely recognized. It is primarily used to convey information about
                  the Component's service type to users and facilitate discovery and integration.


                  The `serviceKind` field is immutable and cannot be updated.

              serviceRefDeclarations:
                description: |-

                items:
                  description: |-
                    ServiceRefDeclaration represents a reference to a service that can be either provided by a KubeBlocks Cluster
                    or an external service.
                    It acts as a placeholder for the actual service reference, which is determined later when a Cluster is created.


                    The purpose of ServiceRefDeclaration is to declare a service dependency without specifying the concrete details
                    of the service.
                    It allows for flexibility and abstraction in defining service references within a Component.
                    By using ServiceRefDeclaration, you can define service dependencies in a declarative manner, enabling loose coupling
                    and easier management of service references across different components and clusters.


                    Upon Cluster creation, the ServiceRefDeclaration is bound to an actual service through the ServiceRef field,
                    effectively resolving and connecting to the specified service.
                  properties:
                    name:

                      description: |-
                        Specifies whether the service reference can be optional.


                        For an optional service-ref, the component can still be created even if the service-ref is not provided.

                        upon Cluster creation.
                        Each ServiceRefDeclarationSpec defines a ServiceKind and ServiceVersion,
                        outlining the acceptable service types and versions that are compatible.


                        This flexibility allows a ServiceRefDeclaration to be fulfilled by any one of the provided specs.
                        For example, if it requires an OLTP database, specs for both MySQL and PostgreSQL are listed,
                        either MySQL or PostgreSQL services can be used when binding.

                              The field is case-insensitive and supports abbreviations for some well-known databases.
                              For instance, both `zk` and `zookeeper` are considered as a ZooKeeper cluster, while `pg`, `postgres`, `postgresql`
                              are all recognized as a PostgreSQL cluster.

                  It follows the syntax and semantics of the "Semantic Versioning" specification (http://semver.org/).


                  The Semantic Versioning specification defines a version number format of X.Y.Z (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), where:


                  - X represents the major version and indicates incompatible API changes.
                  - Y represents the minor version and indicates added functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
                  - Z represents the patch version and indicates backward-compatible bug fixes.


                  Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the X.Y.Z format:


                  - Use pre-release labels (e.g., -alpha, -beta) for versions that are not yet stable or ready for production use.
                  - Use build metadata (e.g., +build.1) for additional version information if needed.


                  Examples of valid ServiceVersion values:


                  - "1.0.0"
                  - "2.3.1"
                  - "3.0.0-alpha.1"
                  - "4.5.2+build.1"


                  The `serviceVersion` field is immutable and cannot be updated.

                  A default headless Service, named `{cluster.name}-{component.name}-headless`, is automatically created
                  for internal Cluster communication.


                  This field enables customization of additional Services to expose the Component's endpoints to
                  other Components within the same or different Clusters, and to external applications.
                  Each Service entry in this list can include properties such as ports, type, and selectors.


                  - For intra-Cluster access, Components can reference Services using variables declared in
                    `componentDefinition.spec.vars[*].valueFrom.serviceVarRef`.

                        and the `roleSelector` field will be ignored.


                        The names of the generated Services will follow the same suffix naming pattern: `$(serviceName)-$(podOrdinal)`.
                        The total number of generated Services will be equal to the number of replicas specified for the Component.


                        Example usage:


                        ```yaml
                        name: my-service
                        serviceName: my-service
                        podService: true

                        ```


                        In this example, if the Component has 3 replicas, three Services will be generated:
                        - my-service-0: Points to the first Pod (podOrdinal: 0)
                        - my-service-1: Points to the second Pod (podOrdinal: 1)
                        - my-service-2: Points to the third Pod (podOrdinal: 2)


                        Each generated Service will have the specified spec configuration and will target its respective Pod.


                        This feature is useful when you need to expose each Pod of a Component individually, allowing external access
                        to specific instances of the Component.

                            traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                            a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                            receive on the ClusterIP. If set to "Local", the proxy will assume that pods
                            only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,
                            dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,
                            "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly
                            (possibly modified by topology and other features).

                            changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4"
                            and "IPv6".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,

                            type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                            options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                            "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                            to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                            specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                            EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                            allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                            than a virtual IP.
                            "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                            routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                            "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                            as the clusterIP.
                            "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                            Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                  An array of `SystemAccount` objects that define the system accounts needed
                  for the management operations of the Component.


                  Each `SystemAccount` includes:


                  - Account name.
                  - The SQL statement template: Used to create the system account.
                  - Password Source: Either generated based on certain rules or retrieved from a Secret.


                   Use cases for system accounts typically involve tasks like system initialization, backups, monitoring,
                   health checks, replication, and other system-level operations.


                  System accounts are distinct from user accounts, although both are database accounts.


                  - **System Accounts**: Created during Cluster setup by the KubeBlocks operator,
                    these accounts have higher privileges for system management and are fully managed
                    through a declarative API by the operator.
                  - **User Accounts**: Managed by users or administrator.
                    User account permissions should follow the principle of least privilege,
                    granting only the necessary access rights to complete their required tasks.

                  Defines variables which are determined after Cluster instantiation and reflect
                  dynamic or runtime attributes of instantiated Clusters.
                  These variables serve as placeholders for setting environment variables in Pods and Actions,
                  or for rendering configuration and script templates before actual values are finalized.


                  These variables are placed in front of the environment variables declared in the Pod if used as
                  environment variables.


                  Variable values can be sourced from:


                  - ConfigMap: Select and extract a value from a specific key within a ConfigMap.
                  - Secret: Select and extract a value from a specific key within a Secret.

                    Intended to obtain the address of a ComponentService within the same Cluster.

                  - ServiceRef: Retrieves address, port, account name and password from a selected ServiceRefDeclaration.
                    Designed to obtain the address bound to a ServiceRef, such as a ClusterService or
                    ComponentService of another cluster or an external service.

                        A Go template expression that will be applied to the resolved value of the var.


                        The expression will only be evaluated if the var is successfully resolved to a non-credential value.


                        The resolved value can be accessed by its name within the expression, system vars and other user-defined
                        non-credential vars can be used within the expression in the same way.
                        Notice that, when accessing vars by its name, you should replace all the "-" in the name with "_", because of
                        that "-" is not a valid identifier in Go.


                        All expressions are evaluated in the order the vars are defined. If a var depends on any vars that also
                        have expressions defined, be careful about the evaluation order as it may use intermediate values.


                        The result of evaluation will be used as the final value of the var. If the expression fails to evaluate,
                        the resolving of var will also be considered failed.

                        Double `$$` are reduced to a single `$`, which allows for escaping the `$(VAR_NAME)` syntax: i.e.

                  - Disk high watermark: Sets the high watermark for the volume's disk usage.
                    When the disk usage reaches the specified threshold, it triggers an alert or action.


                  By configuring these volume behaviors, you can control how the volumes are managed and monitored within the Component.

                        as defined in `componentDefinition.spec.lifecycleActions.readWrite`, restoring full functionality.

          ComponentDefinition serves as a reusable blueprint for creating Components,
          encapsulating essential static settings such as Component description,
          Pod templates, configuration file templates, scripts, parameter lists,
          injected environment variables and their sources, and event handlers.
          ComponentDefinition works in conjunction with dynamic settings from the ClusterComponentSpec,
          to instantiate Components during Cluster creation.


          Key aspects that can be defined in a ComponentDefinition include:


          - PodSpec template: Specifies the PodSpec template used by the Component.
          - Configuration templates: Specify the configuration file templates required by the Component.
          - Scripts: Provide the necessary scripts for Component management and operations.
          - Storage volumes: Specify the storage volumes and their configurations for the Component.
          - Pod roles: Outlines various roles of Pods within the Component along with their capabilities.
          - Exposed Kubernetes Services: Specify the Services that need to be exposed by the Component.
          - System accounts: Define the system accounts required for the Component.
          - Monitoring and logging: Configure the exporter and logging settings for the Component.


          ComponentDefinitions also enable defining reactive behaviors of the Component in response to events,
          such as member join/leave, Component addition/deletion, role changes, switch over, and more.
          This allows for automatic event handling, thus encapsulating complex behaviors within the Component.


          Referencing a ComponentDefinition when creating individual Components ensures inheritance of predefined configurations,
          promoting reusability and consistency across different deployments and cluster topologies.

                  Each template is represented as a ConfigMap and may contain multiple configuration files,
                  with each file being a key in the ConfigMap.


                  The rendered configuration files will be mounted into the Component's containers
                   according to the specified volume mount parameters.

                  When `hostNetwork` option is enabled, the Pods share the host's network namespace and can directly access
                  the host's network interfaces.
                  This means that if multiple Pods need to use the same port, they cannot run on the same host simultaneously
                  due to port conflicts.


                  The DNSPolicy field in the Pod spec determines how containers within the Pod perform DNS resolution.
                  When using hostNetwork, the operator will set the DNSPolicy to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.
                  With this policy, DNS queries will first go through the K8s cluster's DNS service.
                  If the query fails, it will fall back to the host's DNS settings.

                      Use Case:
                      This action is designed to create system accounts that are utilized for replication, monitoring, backup,
                      and other administrative tasks.


                      Note: This field is immutable once it has been set.
                    properties:
                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action.
                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                      Defines the procedure for exporting the data from a replica.


                      Use Case:
                      This action is intended for initializing a newly created replica with data. It involves exporting data
                      from an existing replica and importing it into the new, empty replica. This is essential for synchronizing
                      the state of replicas across the system.


                      Applicability:
                      Some database engines or associated sidecar applications (e.g., Patroni) may already provide this functionality.
                      In such cases, this action may not be required.


                      The output should be a valid data dump streamed to stdout. It must exclude any irrelevant information to ensure
                      that only the necessary data is exported for import into the new replica.


                      Note: This field is immutable once it has been set.
                    properties:
                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.

                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      Use Case:
                      This action is intended for initializing a newly created replica with data. It involves exporting data
                      from an existing replica and importing it into the new, empty replica. This is essential for synchronizing
                      the state of replicas across the system.


                      Some database engines or associated sidecar applications (e.g., Patroni) may already provide this functionality.
                      In such cases, this action may not be required.


                      Data should be received through stdin. If any error occurs during the process,
                      the action must be able to guarantee idempotence to allow for retries from the beginning.


                      Note: This field is immutable once it has been set.

                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.

                      Defines the procedure to add a new replica to the replication group.


                      This action is initiated after a replica pod becomes ready.


                      The role of the replica (e.g., primary, secondary) will be determined and assigned as part of the action command
                      implementation, or automatically by the database kernel or a sidecar utility like Patroni that implements
                      a consensus algorithm.


                      The container executing this action has access to following environment variables:


                      - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service.
                      - KB_PRIMARY_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the primary Pod within the replication group.
                      - KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES: A comma-separated list of Pod addresses for all replicas in the group.
                      - KB_NEW_MEMBER_POD_NAME: The pod name of the replica being added to the group.
                      - KB_NEW_MEMBER_POD_IP: The IP address of the replica being added to the group.


                      Expected action output:
                      - On Failure: An error message detailing the reason for any failure encountered
                        during the addition of the new member.


                      For example, to add a new OBServer to an OceanBase Cluster in 'zone1', the following command may be used:


                      ```yaml
                      command:
                      - bash
                      - -c
                      - |
                         ADDRESS=$(KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES%%,*)
                         HOST=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 1)
                         PORT=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 2)
                         CLIENT="mysql -u $KB_SERVICE_USER -p$KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD -P $PORT -h $HOST -e"
                             $CLIENT "ALTER SYSTEM ADD SERVER '$KB_NEW_MEMBER_POD_IP:$KB_SERVICE_PORT' ZONE 'zone1'"
                      ```

                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action.
                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.

                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      Defines the procedure to remove a replica from the replication group.


                      This action is initiated before remove a replica from the group.
                      The operator will wait for MemberLeave to complete successfully before releasing the replica and cleaning up
                      related Kubernetes resources.


                      The process typically includes updating configurations and informing other group members about the removal.
                      Data migration is generally not part of this action and should be handled separately if needed.


                      The container executing this action has access to following environment variables:


                      - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service.
                      - KB_PRIMARY_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the primary Pod within the replication group.
                      - KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES: A comma-separated list of Pod addresses for all replicas in the group.
                      - KB_LEAVE_MEMBER_POD_NAME: The pod name of the replica being removed from the group.
                      - KB_LEAVE_MEMBER_POD_IP: The IP address of the replica being removed from the group.


                      Expected action output:
                      - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed.


                      For example, to remove an OBServer from an OceanBase Cluster in 'zone1', the following command can be executed:


                      ```yaml
                      command:
                      - bash
                      - -c
                      - |
                         ADDRESS=$(KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES%%,*)
                         HOST=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 1)
                         PORT=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 2)
                         CLIENT="mysql -u $KB_SERVICE_USER  -p$KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD -P $PORT -h $HOST -e"
                             $CLIENT "ALTER SYSTEM DELETE SERVER '$KB_LEAVE_MEMBER_POD_IP:$KB_SERVICE_PORT' ZONE 'zone1'"
                      ```

                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                              - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                              - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action.
                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                        matching the order of pods in KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., "hostIp1,hostIp2").


                      - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_LIST: Comma-separated list of all cluster components (e.g., "comp1,comp2").
                      - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_DELETING_LIST: Comma-separated list of components that are currently being deleted
                        (e.g., "comp1,comp2").
                      - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_UNDELETED_LIST: Comma-separated list of components that are not being deleted
                        (e.g., "comp1,comp2").


                      - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_IS_SCALING_IN: Indicates whether the component is currently scaling in.
                        If this variable is present and set to "true", it denotes that the component is undergoing a scale-in operation.
                        During scale-in, data rebalancing is necessary to maintain cluster integrity.

                        is being cleaned up.

                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.
                        type: string
                      customHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action.
                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                      The container executing this action has access to following environment variables:


                      - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the replica pod whose role is being checked.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service.


                      Expected action output:
                      - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed.

                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                    any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                    the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                    to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                    "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                    Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                    exists or not.

                              - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                              - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      Use Case:
                      This action is used to bring back a replica that was previously in a read-only state,
                      which restricted write operations, to its normal operational state where it can handle
                      both read and write operations.


                      The container executing this action has access to following environment variables:


                      - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the replica pod whose role is being checked.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service.


                      Expected action output:
                      - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed.

                      builtinHandler:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.

                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                        description: |-
                          Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions.


                          Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod,
                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
                          `postgresql`, `official-postgresql`, `apecloud-postgresql`, `wesql`, `oceanbase`, `polardbx`.


                          If the `builtinHandler` field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler
                          to execute the specified lifecycle actions.


                          The `builtinHandler` field is of type `BuiltinActionHandlerType`,
                          which represents the name of the built-in handler.
                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.

                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                      Defines the procedure which is invoked regularly to assess the role of replicas.


                      This action is periodically triggered by Lorry at the specified interval to determine the role of each replica.
                      Upon successful execution, the action's output designates the role of the replica,
                      which should match one of the predefined role names within `componentDefinition.spec.roles`.
                      The output is then compared with the previous successful execution result.
                      If a role change is detected, an event is generated to inform the controller,
                      which initiates an update of the replica's role.


                      Defining a RoleProbe Action for a Component is required if roles are defined for the Component.
                      It ensures replicas are correctly labeled with their respective roles.
                      Without this, services that rely on roleSelectors might improperly direct traffic to wrong replicas.


                      The container executing this action has access to following environment variables:


                      - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the Pod whose role is being assessed.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service.
                      - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service.


                      Expected output of this action:
                      - On Success: The determined role of the replica, which must align with one of the roles specified
                        in the component definition.
                      - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed.

                          includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines.
                          These are known as "builtin" handlers, includes: `mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,

                          The `builtinHandler` specified within the same `ComponentLifecycleActions` should be consistent across all
                          actions.
                          This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler
                          for all other actions throughout the entire `ComponentLifecycleActions` collection.


                          If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support,
                          or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs,
                          you can use the `customHandler` field to define your own action implementation.


                          Deprecation Notice:


                          - In the future, the `builtinHandler` field will be deprecated in favor of using the `customHandler` field
                            for configuring all lifecycle actions.
                          - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry,
                            the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through
                            a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent.
                          - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry
                            or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces.
                          - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions,
                            as developers can create their own "builtin" implementations tailored to their specific requirements.

                          Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action.
                          It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging
                          tailored actions.


                          An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning
                          to support GRPCAction,
                          thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework.


                          In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction.
                          This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions
                          through a GRPC interface for external invocation.
                          Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls.

                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.

                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              Used in conjunction with the `targetPodSelector` field to refine the selection of target pod(s) for Action execution.
                              The impact of this field depends on the `targetPodSelector` value:


                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Any` or `All`, this field will be ignored.
                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              The conditions are as follows:


                              - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                                The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                              - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                              - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                                runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                              - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                              - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                                This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                  Enumerate all possible roles assigned to each replica of the Component, influencing its behavior.


                  A replica can have zero to multiple roles.
                  KubeBlocks operator determines the roles of each replica by invoking the `lifecycleActions.roleProbe` method.
                  This action returns a list of roles for each replica, and the returned roles must be predefined in the `roles` field.


                  The roles assigned to a replica can influence various aspects of the Component's behavior, such as:


                  - Service selection: The Component's exposed Services may target replicas based on their roles using `roleSelector`.
                  - Update order: The roles can determine the order in which replicas are updated during a Component update.
                    For instance, replicas with a "follower" role can be updated first, while the replica with the "leader"
                    role is updated last. This helps minimize the number of leader changes during the update process.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                        An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                        user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                        scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                        removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                        Pod to exceed its resource allocation.


                        To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                        Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                      init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according

                      The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling

                      of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers

                            Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable

                            to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                              skew.
                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.


                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.


                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.


                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.


                                This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                to the PVC after it has been created.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.
                                        If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
                                        in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
                                        it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                                        will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                                        If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                        will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                        If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                        set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                        exists.

                                      ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field
                                      of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.


                                      Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.


                                      ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                                      combination of signer name and a label selector.


                                      Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                      into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                      comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                      The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                      may change the order over time.

              serviceKind:
                description: |-
                  Defines the type of well-known service protocol that the Component provides.
                  It specifies the standard or widely recognized protocol used by the Component to offer its Services.


                  The `serviceKind` field allows users to quickly identify the type of Service provided by the Component
                  based on common protocols or service types. This information helps in understanding the compatibility,
                  interoperability, and usage of the Component within a system.


                  Some examples of well-known service protocols include:


                  - "MySQL": Indicates that the Component provides a MySQL database service.
                  - "PostgreSQL": Indicates that the Component offers a PostgreSQL database service.
                  - "Redis": Signifies that the Component functions as a Redis key-value store.
                  - "ETCD": Denotes that the Component serves as an ETCD distributed key-value store.


                  The `serviceKind` value is case-insensitive, allowing for flexibility in specifying the protocol name.


                  When specifying the `serviceKind`, consider the following guidelines:


                  - Use well-established and widely recognized protocol names or service types.
                  - Ensure that the `serviceKind` accurately represents the primary service type offered by the Component.
                  - If the Component provides multiple services, choose the most prominent or commonly used protocol.
                  - Limit the `serviceKind` to a maximum of 32 characters for conciseness and readability.


                  Note: The `serviceKind` field is optional and can be left empty if the Component does not fit into a well-known
                  service category or if the protocol is not widely recognized. It is primarily used to convey information about
                  the Component's service type to users and facilitate discovery and integration.


                  The `serviceKind` field is immutable and cannot be updated.

              serviceRefDeclarations:
                description: |-

                items:
                  description: |-
                    ServiceRefDeclaration represents a reference to a service that can be either provided by a KubeBlocks Cluster
                    or an external service.
                    It acts as a placeholder for the actual service reference, which is determined later when a Cluster is created.


                    The purpose of ServiceRefDeclaration is to declare a service dependency without specifying the concrete details
                    of the service.
                    It allows for flexibility and abstraction in defining service references within a Component.
                    By using ServiceRefDeclaration, you can define service dependencies in a declarative manner, enabling loose coupling
                    and easier management of service references across different components and clusters.


                    Upon Cluster creation, the ServiceRefDeclaration is bound to an actual service through the ServiceRef field,
                    effectively resolving and connecting to the specified service.
                  properties:
                    name:

                      description: |-
                        Specifies whether the service reference can be optional.


                        For an optional service-ref, the component can still be created even if the service-ref is not provided.

                        upon Cluster creation.
                        Each ServiceRefDeclarationSpec defines a ServiceKind and ServiceVersion,
                        outlining the acceptable service types and versions that are compatible.


                        This flexibility allows a ServiceRefDeclaration to be fulfilled by any one of the provided specs.
                        For example, if it requires an OLTP database, specs for both MySQL and PostgreSQL are listed,
                        either MySQL or PostgreSQL services can be used when binding.

                              The field is case-insensitive and supports abbreviations for some well-known databases.
                              For instance, both `zk` and `zookeeper` are considered as a ZooKeeper cluster, while `pg`, `postgres`, `postgresql`
                              are all recognized as a PostgreSQL cluster.

                  It follows the syntax and semantics of the "Semantic Versioning" specification (http://semver.org/).


                  The Semantic Versioning specification defines a version number format of X.Y.Z (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), where:


                  - X represents the major version and indicates incompatible API changes.
                  - Y represents the minor version and indicates added functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
                  - Z represents the patch version and indicates backward-compatible bug fixes.


                  Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the X.Y.Z format:


                  - Use pre-release labels (e.g., -alpha, -beta) for versions that are not yet stable or ready for production use.
                  - Use build metadata (e.g., +build.1) for additional version information if needed.


                  Examples of valid ServiceVersion values:


                  - "1.0.0"
                  - "2.3.1"
                  - "3.0.0-alpha.1"
                  - "4.5.2+build.1"


                  The `serviceVersion` field is immutable and cannot be updated.

                  A default headless Service, named `{cluster.name}-{component.name}-headless`, is automatically created
                  for internal Cluster communication.


                  This field enables customization of additional Services to expose the Component's endpoints to
                  other Components within the same or different Clusters, and to external applications.
                  Each Service entry in this list can include properties such as ports, type, and selectors.


                  - For intra-Cluster access, Components can reference Services using variables declared in
                    `componentDefinition.spec.vars[*].valueFrom.serviceVarRef`.

                        and the `roleSelector` field will be ignored.


                        The names of the generated Services will follow the same suffix naming pattern: `$(serviceName)-$(podOrdinal)`.
                        The total number of generated Services will be equal to the number of replicas specified for the Component.


                        Example usage:


                        ```yaml
                        name: my-service
                        serviceName: my-service
                        podService: true

                        ```


                        In this example, if the Component has 3 replicas, three Services will be generated:
                        - my-service-0: Points to the first Pod (podOrdinal: 0)
                        - my-service-1: Points to the second Pod (podOrdinal: 1)
                        - my-service-2: Points to the third Pod (podOrdinal: 2)


                        Each generated Service will have the specified spec configuration and will target its respective Pod.


                        This feature is useful when you need to expose each Pod of a Component individually, allowing external access
                        to specific instances of the Component.

                            traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                            a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                            receive on the ClusterIP. If set to "Local", the proxy will assume that pods
                            only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,
                            dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,
                            "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly
                            (possibly modified by topology and other features).

                            changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4"
                            and "IPv6".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,

                            type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                            options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                            "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                            to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                            specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                            EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                            allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                            than a virtual IP.
                            "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                            routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                            "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                            as the clusterIP.
                            "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                            Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                  An array of `SystemAccount` objects that define the system accounts needed
                  for the management operations of the Component.


                  Each `SystemAccount` includes:


                  - Account name.
                  - The SQL statement template: Used to create the system account.
                  - Password Source: Either generated based on certain rules or retrieved from a Secret.


                   Use cases for system accounts typically involve tasks like system initialization, backups, monitoring,
                   health checks, replication, and other system-level operations.


                  System accounts are distinct from user accounts, although both are database accounts.


                  - **System Accounts**: Created during Cluster setup by the KubeBlocks operator,
                    these accounts have higher privileges for system management and are fully managed
                    through a declarative API by the operator.
                  - **User Accounts**: Managed by users or administrator.
                    User account permissions should follow the principle of least privilege,
                    granting only the necessary access rights to complete their required tasks.

                  Defines variables which are determined after Cluster instantiation and reflect
                  dynamic or runtime attributes of instantiated Clusters.
                  These variables serve as placeholders for setting environment variables in Pods and Actions,
                  or for rendering configuration and script templates before actual values are finalized.


                  These variables are placed in front of the environment variables declared in the Pod if used as
                  environment variables.


                  Variable values can be sourced from:


                  - ConfigMap: Select and extract a value from a specific key within a ConfigMap.
                  - Secret: Select and extract a value from a specific key within a Secret.

                    Intended to obtain the address of a ComponentService within the same Cluster.

                    Designed to obtain the address bound to a ServiceRef, such as a ClusterService or

                        A Go template expression that will be applied to the resolved value of the var.


                        The expression will only be evaluated if the var is successfully resolved to a non-credential value.


                        The resolved value can be accessed by its name within the expression, system vars and other user-defined
                        non-credential vars can be used within the expression in the same way.
                        Notice that, when accessing vars by its name, you should replace all the "-" in the name with "_", because of
                        that "-" is not a valid identifier in Go.


                        All expressions are evaluated in the order the vars are defined. If a var depends on any vars that also
                        have expressions defined, be careful about the evaluation order as it may use intermediate values.


                        The result of evaluation will be used as the final value of the var. If the expression fails to evaluate,
                        the resolving of var will also be considered failed.

                        Double `$$` are reduced to a single `$`, which allows for escaping the `$(VAR_NAME)` syntax: i.e.

                description: |-
                  Defines the volumes used by the Component and some static attributes of the volumes.
                  After defining the volumes here, user can reference them in the
                  `cluster.spec.componentSpecs[*].volumeClaimTemplates` field to configure dynamic properties such as
                  volume capacity and storage class.


                  This field allows you to specify the following:


                  - Snapshot behavior: Determines whether a snapshot of the volume should be taken when performing
                    a snapshot backup of the Component.
                  - Disk high watermark: Sets the high watermark for the volume's disk usage.
                    When the disk usage reaches the specified threshold, it triggers an alert or action.


                  By configuring these volume behaviors, you can control how the volumes are managed and monitored within the Component.


                  This field is immutable.

                      description: |-
                        Sets the critical threshold for volume space utilization as a percentage (0-100).


                        Exceeding this percentage triggers the system to switch the volume to read-only mode as specified in
                        `componentDefinition.spec.lifecycleActions.readOnly`.
                        This precaution helps prevent space depletion while maintaining read-only access.
                        If the space utilization later falls below this threshold, the system reverts the volume to read-write mode
                        as defined in `componentDefinition.spec.lifecycleActions.readWrite`, restoring full functionality.
