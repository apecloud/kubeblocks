                        ConfigConstraint allows defining constraints and validation rules for configuration parameters.
                        It ensures that the configuration adheres to certain requirements and limitations.

                            generate the final configuration file in the startup script based on these variables.


                            This field allows users to specify a list of container names, and KubeBlocks will inject the environment

                            YAML supports both octal and decimal values for file permissions.

                            Directories within the specified path are not impacted by this setting.
                            It's important to be aware that this setting might conflict with other options
                            that influence the file mode, such as fsGroup.
