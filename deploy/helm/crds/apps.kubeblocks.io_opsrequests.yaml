                                            bucket. We define a domain as a particular
                                            instance of a topology. Also, we define
                                            an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes
                                            meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy
                                            and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey
                                            is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node
                                            is a domain of that topology. And, if
                                            TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone",
                                            each zone is a domain of that topology.
                                            It's a required field.

                                            giving higher precedence to topologies
                                            that would help reduce the skew. A constraint

                                            1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                                            spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3
                                            | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable
                                            is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod
                                            can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)
                                            to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1)

                                                    For backwards compatibility, when

                                                    to the same value automatically
                                                    if one of them is empty and the
                                                    other is non-empty. When namespace

                                                    are three important differences
                                                    between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows
                                                    two specific types of objects,
                                                    dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                                    objects. * While dataSource ignores
                                                    disallowed values (dropping them),
                                                    dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                                    and generates an error if a disallowed
                                                    value is specified. * While dataSource
                                                    only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows objects in any namespaces.

                        different configurations when being restored as a standby
                        compared to being restored as a primary. For example, when
                        restoring MySQL as a replica, you need to set `skip_slave_start=\"ON\"`
                        for 5.7 or `skip_replica_start=\"ON\"` for 8.0. Allowing environment
                        variables to be passed in makes it more convenient to control
                        these behavioral differences during the restore process."

                                            to be in the same topology. We consider
                                            each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try
                                            to put balanced number of pods into each
                                            bucket. We define a domain as a particular

                                            meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy
                                            and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey
                                            is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node
                                            is a domain of that topology. And, if
                                            TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone",
                                            each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                            giving higher precedence to topologies

                                            1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                                            spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3

                                            is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod

                                                    For backwards compatibility, when
                                                    namespace isn''t specified in

                                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set
                                                    to the same value automatically
                                                    if one of them is empty and the
                                                    other is non-empty. When namespace

                                                    are three important differences
                                                    between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows
                                                    two specific types of objects,
                                                    dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                                    objects. * While dataSource ignores
                                                    disallowed values (dropping them),
                                                    dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                                    and generates an error if a disallowed
                                                    value is specified. * While dataSource
                                                    only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows objects in any namespaces.
