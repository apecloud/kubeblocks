                                                as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                                values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates
                                                an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified. * While dataSource only

                                                allows objects in any namespaces.

                                                    For backwards compatibility, when
                                                    namespace isn''t specified in

                                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set
                                                    to the same value automatically
                                                    if one of them is empty and the
                                                    other is non-empty. When namespace
                                                    is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn''t set to the same

                                                    are three important differences
                                                    between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows
                                                    two specific types of objects,
                                                    dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                                    objects. * While dataSource ignores
                                                    disallowed values (dropping them),
                                                    dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                                    and generates an error if a disallowed
                                                    value is specified. * While dataSource
                                                    only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows objects in any namespaces.

                                                    For backwards compatibility, when

                                                    to the same value automatically
                                                    if one of them is empty and the
                                                    other is non-empty. When namespace

                                                    are three important differences
                                                    between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows
                                                    two specific types of objects,
                                                    dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                                    objects. * While dataSource ignores
                                                    disallowed values (dropping them),
                                                    dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                                    and generates an error if a disallowed
                                                    value is specified. * While dataSource
                                                    only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows objects in any namespaces.
