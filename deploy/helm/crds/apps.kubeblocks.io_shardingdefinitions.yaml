                      By setting `postProvision.preCondition`, you can determine the specific lifecycle stage at which
                      the action should trigger, available conditions for sharding include: `Immediately`, `ComponentReady`,
                      and `ClusterReady`. For sharding, the `ComponentReady` condition means all components of the sharding are ready.


                      With `ComponentReady` being the default.


                      The PostProvision Action is intended to run only once.

                              Commands are executed directly without a shell environment, meaning shell-specific syntax ('|', etc.) is not supported.
                              If the shell is required, it must be explicitly invoked in the command.


                              A successful execution is indicated by an exit status of 0; any non-zero status signifies a failure.

                              The name must match one of the containers defined in `componentDefinition.spec.runtime`.

                              Used in conjunction with the `targetPodSelector` field to refine the selection of target pod(s) for Action execution.
                              The impact of this field depends on the `targetPodSelector` value:


                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Any` or `All`, this field will be ignored.
                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              Defines the criteria used to select the target Pod(s) for executing the Action.
                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.


                              If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod
                              to be removed or added; or a random pod if the Action is triggered at the component level, such as
                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          Currently, this is only applicable to the `postProvision` action.


                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.


                              If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod

                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Any` or `All`, this field will be ignored.
                              - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                will be selected for the Action.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.


                              If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod

                              post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                                will be selected for the Action.

                              This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                              It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.

                          The conditions are as follows:


                          - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                            The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                          - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                            runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                          - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                            This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                          - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                            This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.
