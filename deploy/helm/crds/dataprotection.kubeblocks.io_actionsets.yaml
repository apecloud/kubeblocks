                  Specifies the backup type. Supported values include:


                  - `Full` for a full backup.
                  - `Incremental` back up data that have changed since the last backup (either full or incremental).
                  - `Differential` back up data that has changed since the last full backup.
                  - `Continuous` back up transaction logs continuously, such as MySQL binlog, PostgreSQL WAL, etc.
                  - `Selective` back up data more precisely, use custom parameters, such as specific databases or tables.


                  Continuous backup is essential for implementing Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR).
