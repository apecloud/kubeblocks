The JupyterHub Helm chart is accompanied with an installation guide at [z2jh.jupyter.org](https://z2jh.jupyter.org). Together they enable you to deploy [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io) in a Kubernetes cluster that can make Jupyter environments available to several thousands of simultaneous users.

## History

Much of the initial groundwork for this documentation is information learned from the successful use of JupyterHub and Kubernetes at UC Berkeley in their [Data 8](http://data8.org/) program.
