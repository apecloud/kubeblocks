  deploymentStrategy:
    ## type: Recreate
    ## - JupyterHub's interaction with the CHP proxy becomes a lot more robust
    ##   with this configuration. To understand this, consider that JupyterHub
    ##   during startup will interact a lot with the k8s service to reach a
    ##   ready proxy pod. If the hub pod during a helm upgrade is restarting
    ##   directly while the proxy pod is making a rolling upgrade, the hub pod
    ##   could end up running a sequence of interactions with the old proxy pod
    ##   and finishing up the sequence of interactions with the new proxy pod.
    ##   As CHP proxy pods carry individual state this is very error prone. One
    ##   outcome when not using Recreate as a strategy has been that user pods
    ##   have been deleted by the hub pod because it considered them unreachable
    ##   as it only configured the old proxy pod but not the new before trying
    ##   to reach them.

      # IMPORTANT: Bumping the minor version of this binary should go hand in

      #
      #            Debugging advice:
      #
      #            - Is configuration of kube-scheduler broken in
      #              templates/scheduling/user-scheduler/configmap.yaml?
      #
      #            - Is the kube-scheduler binary's compatibility to work
      #              against a k8s api-server that is too new or too old?
      #
      #            - You can update the GitHub workflow that runs tests to
      #              include "deploy/user-scheduler" in the k8s namespace report
      #              and reduce the user-scheduler deployments replicas to 1 in
      #              dev-config.yaml to get relevant logs from the user-scheduler
      #              pods. Inspect the "Kubernetes namespace report" action!
      #
      #            - Typical failures are that kube-scheduler fails to search for
      #              resources via its "informers", and won't start trying to
      #              schedule pods before they succeed which may require
      #              additional RBAC permissions or that the k8s api-server is
      #              aware of the resources.
      #
      #            - If "successfully acquired lease" can be seen in the logs, it
      #              is a good sign kube-scheduler is ready to schedule pods.
