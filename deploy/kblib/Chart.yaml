# This is a library helm chart for KubeBlocks. It is not intended to be installed on its own.
# This chart is used to define common templates, values and values json schema that can be used by other charts.

# NOTE:
# The chart that uses this library chart must have a dependency on this chart and must specify the alias as 'extra'.
# The template files in this chart should use the alias to reference the values in this chart.
# For example: # {{ .Values.extra.terminationPolicy }}
#
# This chart uses format like {{ .Values.version }} to reference the values in the parent chart.
