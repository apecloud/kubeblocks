## Basic Concepts
The core of `KubeBlocks` is a K8s operator built on [KubeBuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction). Before you start, please make sure you have basic understanding of:
- [Basic usage of KubeBlocks](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/preview/user_docs/overview/introduction)
    - Please install `kbcli` and attempt to create a MySQL cluster and establish a connection follow the [guidelines](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/release-0.8/user_docs/kubeblocks-for-mysql).
- [CRD(Custom Resource Definitions)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/)
- [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
 
## Setup a Kubernetes development environment
To run `KubeBlocks`, you needs `Docker` and a `Kubernetes` 1.22+ cluster for development.

#### Docker environment
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
   > For Linux, you'll have to configure docker to run without `sudo` for the KubeBlocks build scripts to work. Follow the instructions to [manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).


#### Kubernetes environment
- Kubernetes cluster
  You can use cloud Kubernetes service, such as [`EKS`](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) [`GKE`](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) [`AKS`](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/), or use local Kubernetes cluster, such as [`Minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) [`k3d`](https://k3d.io/stable/) [`KIND`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
- For development purposes, you will also want to follow the optional steps to install [Helm 3.x](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Setup development environment
There are two options for getting an environment up and running for `KubeBlocks` development：1. Bring your own toolbox; 2. Use development container. Using dev container is optional.

### Bring your own toolbox
To build `KubeBlocks` on your own host, needs to install the following tools:
- Go (Golang)
- Make

#### Install Go
Download and install [Go 1.21 or later](https://go.dev/doc/install).
#### Install Make
`KubeBlocks` uses `make` for a variety of build and test actions, and needs to be installed as appropriate for your platform:

- Linux
    1. Install the `build-essential` package:
       ```shell
       sudo apt-get install build-essential
       ```
- macOS
    1. Ensure that build tools are installed:
       ```shell
       xcode-select --install
       ```
    2. When completed, you should see `make` and other command line developer tools in `/usr/bin`.

#### Build KubeBlocks
When `go` and `make` are installed, you can clone the `KubeBlocks` repository, and build `KubeBlocks`  binaries with the `make` tool.
- To build for your current local environment:
  ```shell
  make all
  ```
- To cross-compile for a different platform, use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environmental variables:
  ```shell
  make all GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64
  ```

### Use development container
If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can connect to a [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) configured for KubeBlocks development. With development container, you don't need to manually install all of the tools and frameworks needed.

#### Setup the development container
1. Install VSCode [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Open the `KubeBlocks` project folder in VSCode
    - VSCode will detect the presence of a dev container definition in the repo and will prompt you to reopen the project in a container:
      ![reopen dev container by pop notification](./img/reopen_dev_container_notification.png)
    - Alternatively, you can open the command palette and use the Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container command:
      ![reopen dev container by command](./img/reopen_dev_container_command.png)
    - VSCode will pull image and start dev container automatically, once the container is loaded, open an integrated terminal in VS Code and you're ready to develop `KubeBlocks` in a containerized environment.
3. And you can run `make all` to build `KubeBlocks` in the dev container.

#### Customize your dev container
##### Use a custom dev container image
The [devcontainer.json](../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) uses the latest image from [ApeCloud Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apecloud/kubeblocks-dev), you can customize image to suit your need.
1. Edit the [docker/Dockerfile-dev](../docker/Dockerfile-dev) dev container image definition, you can change the `[Option]` configuration or install additional tools.
    ```Dockerfile
    # Copy library scripts to execute
    COPY library-scripts/*.sh library-scripts/*.env /tmp/library-scripts/

    # [Option] Install zsh
    ARG INSTALL_ZSH="true"

    # [Optional] Uncomment the next line to use go get to install anything else you need
    # RUN go get -x <your-dependency-or-tool>

    # [Optional] Uncomment this section to install additional OS packages.
    # RUN apt-get update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    #     && apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends <your-package-list-here>

    # [Optional] Uncomment this line to install global node packages.
    # RUN su vscode -c "source /usr/local/share/nvm/nvm.sh && npm install -g <your-package-here>" 2>&
    ```
2. Build a new image using updated `Dockerfile`, and replace the `"image"` property in [devcontainer.json](../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).
    ```json
    {
        // Update to your dev container image
        "image": "docker.io/apecloud/kubeblocks-dev:latest",
    }

    ```
3. Rebuild and reopen the workspace in the dev container via the command palette and the `Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen` in Container command.
4. When you are satisfied with your changes, you can optionally publish your container image to your own registry to speed up rebuilding the container when you only want to make changes to the `devcontainer.json` configuration in the future. For a docker image named `docker.io/xxxx/kubeblocks-dev`:
    ```shell
    make build-dev-image DEV_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME=docker.io/xxxx/kubeblocks-dev
    ```

##### Connect existing Kubernetes cluster
If you want to reuse an existing Kubernetes config, such as your [`EKS`](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster or local [`Minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) cluster, you can configure the `devcontainer.json` copy those settings into the dev container. This requires:

1. Enabling the `SYNC_LOCALHOST_KUBECONFIG` environment variable
2. Bind mounting the locations of your Kubernetes and Minikube config paths to `/home/kubeblocks/.kube-localhost` and `/home/kubeblocks/.minikube-localhost` respectively.
    - You don't need to bind the Minikube path if you're not using it.
    ```json
    "containerEnv": {
        // Uncomment to overwrite devcontainer .kube/config and .minikube certs with the localhost versions
        // each time the devcontainer starts, if the respective .kube-localhost/config and .minikube-localhost
        // folders respectively are bind mounted to the devcontainer.
        "SYNC_LOCALHOST_KUBECONFIG": "true",
    },

    ...

    "mounts": [
    // Uncomment to clone local .kube/config into devcontainer
    "type=bind,source=${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.kube,target=/home/kubeblocks/.kube-localhost",

    // Uncomment to additionally clone minikube certs into devcontainer for use with .kube/config
    "type=bind,source=${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.minikube,target=/home/kubeblocks/.minikube-localhost"

    ]
    ```
> ⚠ The `SYNC_LOCALHOST_KUBECONFIG` option only supports providing the dev container with the snapshot configuration from the host and does not support updating the host Kubernetes configuration from the dev container directly.

## Deploying released version of KubeBlocks
Here we present an example of deploying released version of `KubeBlocks` locally and utilizing it to create an `mysql` cluster. 

#### Install `KubeBlocks`
- Install [`kbcli`](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/release-0.8/user_docs/installation/install-with-kbcli/install-kbcli)
- Install [`KubeBlocks`](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/release-0.8/user_docs/installation/install-with-kbcli/install-kubeblocks-with-kbcli): `kbcli kubeblocks install`. This will install `KubeBlocks` and start running its manager.

#### Install `mysql` addon 
Databases can be added as addons in `KubeBlocks`. To test with `mysql`, you need to install and enable corresponding addon. You can install addons through [Helm](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/release-0.8/developer_docs/integration/how-to-add-an-add-on). Here is a simpler example using [`kbcli`](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/release-0.8/user_docs/kubeblocks-for-mysql/cluster-management/create-and-connect-a-mysql-cluster):

```shell
# make sure there is an index
kbcli addon index list
# search supported addon
kbcli addon search mysql  
# install addon
kbcli addon install mysql --index kubeblocks --version [YOUR_VERSION]
# enable addon
kbcli addon enable mysql
# list the addons again to check whether it is enabled.
kbcli addon list
```
#### Test with `mysql`
Here, we present a simple example of creating an `mysql` cluster.
- [Create `mysql` cluster](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/release-0.8/user_docs/kubeblocks-for-mysql/cluster-management/create-and-connect-a-mysql-cluster) 
```
kbcli cluster create mysql mycluster
```
- You can use `kbcli cluster list` to see information of clusters.

## Deploy your development version of the controller
Here we present an example of deploying your development version(e.g., Debugging) of the controller locally and utilizing it to create an `mysql` cluster.
#### Deploy 
- Follow instructions above to [install `mysql` addon](#install-mysql-addon).
- Stop the manager of `KubeBlocks` you just install: 
```shell
kubectl scale deployment kubeblocks --replicas=0 -n kb-system
```
- Generate CRD: `make manifests`. This will create CRD of your `KubeBlocks`.
- Deploy CRD: `make install`. This will register CR to cluster.
- Start your operator: `make run`. This will start your `KubeBlocks` controller and output logs.

Now you can test with creating `mysql` cluster following instructions [above](#test-with-mysql).

#### Debug
To observe the behavior of `KubeBlocks`, it is recommended to debug and trace its execution. The central function responsible for controlling the execution is `Reconcile`. In the mentioned example, creating a cluster will activate the `Reconcile` function located in `controllers/apps/cluster_controller.go`. To trace the execution process, you can:
- Set a breakpoint on `Reconcile` function in `controllers/apps/cluster_controller.go`
- And then start manager in `cmd/manager/main.go`

More information about debugging can be found in [Debug](03%20-%20debug.md#debug).
