# Simulate network faults

Network faults support partition, net emulation (including loss, delay, duplicate, and corrupt), and bandwidth.

* Partition: injects network disconnection and partition.
* Net emulation: simulates poor network conditions, such as high delays, high packet loss rate, packet reordering, and so on.
* Bandwidth: limits the communication bandwidth between nodes.

## Before you start

* During the network injection process, make sure that the connection between Controller Manager and Chaos Daemon works. Otherwise, the NetworkChaos cannot be restored anymore.
* If you want to simulate Net emulation fault, make sure the `NET_SCH_NETEM` module is installed in the Linux kernel. If you are using CentOS, you can install the module through the kernel-modules-extra package. Most other Linux distributions have installed the module already by default.

## Simulate fault injections by kbcli

Common flags for all types of network faults.
