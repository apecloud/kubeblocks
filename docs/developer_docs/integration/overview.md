# Overview

KubeBlocks is a control and management platform to manage a bunch of database engines and other add-ons.

This series provides basic knowledge of add-ons, so you can get a quick start and become a member of the KubeBlocks community.

KubeBlocks add-ons feature a rich ecosystem with multiple major databases, including:

- Relational Database: ApeCloud-MySQL (MySQL RaftGroup cluster), PostgreSQL (Replication cluster) 
- NoSQL Database: MongoDB, Redis
- Graph Database: Nebula (from community contributors)
- Time Series Database: TDengine, Greptime (from community contributors)
- Vector Database: Milvus, Qdrant, Waeviate, etc.
- Message Queue: Kafka

In addition to creating and deleting a cluster, KubeBlocks has also supported basic operations like scaling out, scaling up, monitoring, backup, and so on.
