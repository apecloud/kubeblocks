We would like to extend our appreciation to all contributors who helped make this release happen.

**Breaking changes**


**Highlights**


**Known issues and limitations**
  * Limitations of cluster's horizontal scale operation:
    * Only support VolumeSnapshot API to make a clone of Cluster's PV for syncing data when horizontal scaling.
    * Only 1st pod container and 1st volume mount associated PV will be processed for VolumeSnapshot, do assure that data volume is placed in 1st pod container's 1st volume mount.
    * Unused PVCs will be deleted in 30 minutes after scale in.
