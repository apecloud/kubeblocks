# KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version ($today)

We're happy to announce the release of KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version! ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽˆ

We would like to extend our thanks to all the new and existing contributors who helped make this release happen.

**Highlights**

  * Limitations of cluster's horizontal scale operation:
    * Only support VolumeSnapshot API to make a clone of Cluster's PV needs sync data when horizontal scaling.
    * Only 1st pod container and 1st volume mount associated PV will be processed for VolumeSnapshot, do assure that data volume is placed in 1st pod container's 1st volume mount.
    * Unused PVCs will be deleted 30 minutes after scale in.
