# KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version ($today)

We're happy to announce the release of KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version! ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽˆ

We would like to extend our appreciation to all contributors who helped make this release happen.

**Highlights**

  * Limitations of cluster's horizontal scale operation:
    * Only support VolumeSnapshot API to make a clone of Cluster's PV for syncing data when horizontal scaling.
    * Only 1st pod container and 1st volume mount associated PV will be processed for VolumeSnapshot, do assure that data volume is placed in 1st pod container's 1st volume mount.
    * Unused PVCs will be deleted in 30 minutes after scale in.

## Upgrading to KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version

To upgrade to this release of KubeBlocks, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade.

Release Notes for `v0.3.0`:
- Rename CRD name `backupjobs.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io` to `backups.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io`
  - upgrade KubeBlocks with the following command:
      ```
      helm upgrade --install kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version 0.3.0
      ```
  - after you upgrade KubeBlocks, check CRD `backupjobs.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io` and delete it
    ```
    kubectl delete crd backupjobs.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io
    ```
- Rename CRD name `appversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io` to `clusterversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io`
  - before you upgrade KubeBlocks, please backup your Cluster CR yaml first.
    ```
    kubectl get cluster -oyaml > clusters.yaml
    ```
    then replace all spec.appVersionRef to spec.clusterVersionRef in the clusters.yaml.

    Then, handle OpsRequest CR the same way.
  - after you upgrade KubeBlocks, you can delete the CRD `appversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io`
    ```
    kubectl delete crd appversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io
    ```
    the last step, use the above backup of Clusters and OpsRequests to apply them.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f clusters.yaml
      ```
- Rename group name `dbaas.kubeblocks.io` to `apps.kubeblocks.io`
    - upgrade kubeblocks to create new CRDs, after that, you can delete the CRDs with group name`dbaas.kubeblocks.io`
