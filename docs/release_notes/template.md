# KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version ($today)

We're happy to announce the release of KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version! ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽˆ

This release introduces Redis, a key-value database, and MongoDB, a document-based database. It also supports the primary-secondary topology of PostgreSQL, adapts to more public cloud vendors' hosted Kubernetes versions, improves data backup and recovery experiences, and builds basic data migration capability. We noticed that some users may think that K8s reduces database performance. So in this release we include a comparison test result to explain the throughput and RT differences of various MySQL 8.0 deployment forms on AWS.

We would like to extend our appreciation to all contributors who helped make this release happen.

## **Highlights**

- KubeBlocks supports the primary-secondary topology of PostgreSQL
  Users can actively switch the primary-secondary role of the database cluster with kbcli, or passively trigger failover by deleting a specified Kubernetes pod with kubectl. Failover generally completes within 30 seconds when there are no long transactions and large table DDLs.
- KubeBlocks supports Redis v7.0
  Redis is currently the most popular open-source key-value database, supporting data types such as key-value, string, list, set, hash table, and ordered set. It provides extremely fast data read and write operations and is suitable for cache scenarios in e-commerce, social communication, game, and other internet applications. To provide stable, secure, and efficient Redis services to users, KubeBlocks has adopted Redis 7.0 version, which is currently recommended officially, supporting standalone and primary-secondary topologies. Thus, users can perform operations such as creating, deleting, scaling, backing up, restoring, monitoring, alerting, and changing parameters of Redis clusters in development, testing, and production environments.
- KubeBlocks supports MongoDB v5.0
  MongoDB is currently the most popular document-based database, using JSON data types and dynamic schema designs to maintain high flexibility and scalability. KubeBlocks supports the replica set topology of MongoDB v5.0, providing data redundancy and automatic failover capabilities, ensuring data availability and consistency in the event of a node failure. The replica set topology cluster has one primary node (Primary) and several secondary nodes (Secondary), with the primary node handling all write requests and the secondary nodes handling some read requests. If the primary node fails, one of the secondary nodes is elected as the new primary node.
- KubeBlocks supports the private deployment of ChatGPT retrieval plugin
  For users who do not want to expose sensitive information (such as company documents, meeting minutes, emails), OpenAI has open-sourced the ChatGPT retrieval plugin to enhance the ChatGPT experience. As long as users meet OpenAI's requirements, they can run the ChatGPT retrieval plugin through KubeBlocks addon, store the vectorized data of sensitive information in a private database, and enable ChatGPT to have longer memory of the context while ensuring information security.
- KubeBlocks supports one-command launching of playgrounds on Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, and GCP
  Public cloud vendors' hosted Kubernetes services have significant differences in version, functionality, and integration, so even if the deployment of stateful services is not difficult, but Kubernetes administrators  have to do a lot of extra heavy lifting to run stateful services normally. After supporting AWS, KubeBlocks provides the ability to one-command launch playgrounds on Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, and GCP. Users only need to set up public cloud AK locally, and then execute the kbcli playground init command, and KubeBlocks will automatically apply for resources and configure permissions in the specified region, making it easy for users to experience complete functionality. After trying KubeBlocks out, you can clean up the playground environment with one command to avoid incurring costs.

## **Breaking changes**

- Breaking changes between v0.5 and v0.4. Uninstall v0.4 (including any older version) before installing v0.5.
    - Move the backupPolicyTemplate API from dataprotection group to apps group.
      Before installing v0.5, please ensure that the resources have been cleaned up:
       ```
         kubectl delete backuppolicytemplates.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io --all
         kubectl delete backuppolicies.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io --all
       ```
    - redefines the phase of cluster and component.
      Before installing v0.5, please ensure that the resources have been cleaned up:
       ```
         kubectl delete clusters.apps.kubeblocks.io --all
         kubectl delete opsrequets.apps.kubeblocks.io --all
       ```
- `addons.extensions.kubeblocks.io` API deleted `spec.helm.valuesMapping.jsonMap.additionalProperties`, `spec.helm.valuesMapping.valueMap.additionalProperties`, `spec.helm.valuesMapping.extras.jsonMap.additionalProperties` and `spec.helm.valuesMapping.extras.valueMap.additionalProperties` attributes that was introduced by CRD generator, all existing Addons API YAML shouldn't have referenced these attributes.


## **Known issues and limitations**
* Limitations of cluster's horizontal scale operation:
  * Only support VolumeSnapshot API to make a clone of Cluster's PV for syncing data when horizontal scaling.
  * Only 1st pod container and 1st volume mount associated PV will be processed for VolumeSnapshot, do assure that data volume is placed in 1st pod container's 1st volume mount.
  * Unused PVCs will be deleted in 30 minutes after scale in.
