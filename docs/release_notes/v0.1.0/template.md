    * KB_COMP_NAME - Running pod's KubeBlock Cluster API object's `.spec.components.name`
    * KB_CLUSTER_COMP_NAME - Running pod's KubeBlock Cluster API object's `<.metadata.name>-<.spec.components.name>`, same name is used for Deployment or StatefulSet workload name, and Service object name
  * New KubeBlocks addon extensions management (an addon components are part of KubeBlocks control plane extensions). Highlights include: 
    * New addons.extensions.kubeblocks.io API that provide running cluster installable check and auto-installation settings.
    * Following addons are provided:

      * ApeCloud MySQL ClusterDefinition API
      * Community PostgreSQL ClusterDefinition API
      * Community Redis ClusterDefinition API
      * Cluster availability demo application named NyanCat
  * ClusterDefinition API `spec.connectionCredential` add following built-in variables:
    * A random UUID v4 generator `$(UUID)`
    * A random UUID v4 generator with BASE64 encoded `$(UUID_B64)`
    * A random UUID v4 generator in UUID string then BASE64 encoded `$(UUID_STR_B64)`
    * A random UUID v4 generator in HEX representation `$(UUID_HEX)`
    * Service FQDN `$(SVC_FQDN)` placeholder, value pattern - $(CLUSTER_NAME)-$(1ST_COMP_NAME).$(NAMESPACE).svc, where 1ST_COMP_NAME is the 1st component that provide `ClusterDefinition.spec.componentDefs[].service` attribute
    * Service ports `$(SVC_PORT_<NAME>)` placeholder
    * example usage:
    
  ```yaml
  # ClusterDefinition API
  kind: ClusterDefinition
    metadata:
    name: my-clusterdefinition
  spec:
    connectionCredential:
      username: "admin" 
      "admin-password": "$(RANDOM_PASSWD)"
      endpoint: "http://$(SVC_FQDN):$(SVC_PORT_http)"

    componentsDefs:
      - name: my-comp-type
        service:
          ports:
            - name: http
              port: 8123

  # Cluster API
  kind: Cluster
  metadata:
    name: my-cluster
    namespace: my-ns
  spec:
    clusterDefinitionRef: my-clusterdefinition
    componentSpecs:
      - name: my-comp
        type: my-comp-type

  # output:
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: my-cluster-conn-credential
    namespace: my-ns
    labels:
      "app.kubernetes.io/instance": my-cluster
  stringData:
    username: "admin"
    admin-password: "<some random 8 characters password>"
    endpoint: "http://my-cluster-my-comp.my-ns.svc:8123"
  ```

**Known issues and limitations**
  * Limitations of cluster's horizontal scale operation:
    * Only support VolumeSnapshot API to make a clone of Cluster's PV for syncing data when horizontal scaling.
    * Only 1st pod container and 1st volume mount associated PV will be processed for VolumeSnapshot, do assure that data volume is placed in 1st pod container's 1st volume mount.
    * Unused PVCs will be deleted in 30 minutes after scale in.

## Upgrading to KubeBlocks $kubeblocks_version

To upgrade to this release of KubeBlocks, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade.

Release Notes for `v0.3.0`:
- Rename CRD name `backupjobs.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io` to `backups.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io`
  - upgrade KubeBlocks with the following command:
    ```
    helm upgrade --install kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version 0.3.0
    ```
  - after you upgrade KubeBlocks, check CRD `backupjobs.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io` and delete it
    ```
    kubectl delete crd backupjobs.dataprotection.kubeblocks.io
    ```
- Rename CRD name `appversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io` to `clusterversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io`
  - before you upgrade KubeBlocks, please backup your Cluster CR yaml first.
    ```
    kubectl get cluster -oyaml > clusters.yaml
    ```
    then replace all spec.appVersionRef to spec.clusterVersionRef in the clusters.yaml.

    Then, handle OpsRequest CR the same way.
  - after you upgrade KubeBlocks, you can delete the CRD `appversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io`
    ```
    kubectl delete crd appversions.dbaas.kubeblocks.io
    ```
    the last step, use the above backup of Clusters and OpsRequests to apply them.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f clusters.yaml
      ```
- Rename group name `dbaas.kubeblocks.io` to `apps.kubeblocks.io`
    - upgrade kubeblocks to create new CRDs, after that, you can delete the CRDs with group name`dbaas.kubeblocks.io`

## Breaking Changes

$kubeblocks_breaking_changes
* Refactored the use of labels. Existing clusters or config need to manually update their labels to ensure proper functionality. The following are specific changes:
  - Pods of `statefulset` and `deployment`
    - Replace label name from `app.kubernetes.io/component-name` to `apps.kubeblocks.io/component-name`
    - Replace label name from `app.kubeblocks.io/workload-type` to `apps.kubeblocks.io/workload-type`
    - Add label `app.kubernetes.io/version` with value `Cluster.Spec.ClusterVersionRef`
    - Add label `app.kubernetes.io/component` with value `Cluster.Spec.ComponentSpecs.ComponentDefRef`
  - CR `backuppolicytemplate`
    - Replace label name from `app.kubernetes.io/created-by` to `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by`
  - Configmap hosted by KubeBlocks and named with `*-env` suffix
    - Replace label name from `app.kubernetes.io/config-type` to `apps.kubeblocks.io/config-type`
* With KubeBlocks Helm chart replaced its optional components install using sub-charts dependencies with Addons extensions API, previous version upgrade to this version will uninstall the optional components completely.
