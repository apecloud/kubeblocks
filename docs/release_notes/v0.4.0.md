# KubeBlocks 0.4.0 (2023-02-06)

We're happy to announce the release of KubeBlocks 0.4.0! 🚀 🎉 🎈

We would like to extend our appreciation to all contributors who helped make this release happen.

**Highlights**

  * Limitations of cluster's horizontal scale operation:
    * Only support VolumeSnapshot API to make a clone of Cluster's PV for syncing data when horizontal scaling.
    * Only 1st pod container and 1st volume mount associated PV will be processed for VolumeSnapshot, do assure that data volume is placed in 1st pod container's 1st volume mount.
    * Unused PVCs will be deleted in 30 minutes after scale in.
    * Support stop cluster to release compute resources and start the stopped cluster.
  * Limitations of replicationSet workloadType lifeCycle:
    * ReplicationSet switchover and failover high-availability switching are not supported for the time being. The current version only supports the replicationSet switch API definition, and the specific implementation will be supported in the next major version.
