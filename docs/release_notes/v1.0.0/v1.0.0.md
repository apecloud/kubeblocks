# KubeBlocks 1.0.0 (2025-05-28)

We are glad to announce the release of KubeBlocks 1.0.0.

KubeBlocks 1.0.0 marks a significant milestone, with key APIs graduating to stable (v1) and substantial enhancements in cluster management, data protection, and operational stability—bringing greater flexibility and reliability to production environments.

## Highlights

### APIs Graduated to Stable

KubeBlocks 0.9 introduced flexible topologies, advanced pod management (InstanceSet), and lifecycle hooks. Many of these features have now **graduated to stable**.

The following CRDs are now **`v1` and considered stable**, with long-term support:

**`apps.kubeblocks.io` API Group:**

* `ClusterDefinition`
* `Cluster`
* `ComponentDefinition`
* `Component`
* `ComponentVersion`
* `ServiceDescriptor`
* `ShardingDefinition`
* `SidecarDefinition`

**`workloads.kubeblocks.io` API Group:**

* `InstanceSet`

### KubeBlocks Features

* **Rolling Updates**: Supports rolling upgrades via the Cluster API, minimizing downtime during updates
* **Incremental Backups**: Introduces support for incremental backups to improve performance and reduce storage usage

### KubeBlocks Addon Highlights

* **MySQL Enhancements**: Adds TLS, group replication with ProxySQL, and PITR using WAL-G—boosting security and recovery
* **MongoDB PITR & Versioning**: Introduces Point-in-Time Recovery and new version support for MongoDB
* **Kafka Improvements**: Supports external ZooKeeper, custom Prometheus metrics, and multi-network access for better flexibility and observability
* **Redis Enhancements**: Adds cluster switchover, instance rebuild, and external config support to improve operational robustness
