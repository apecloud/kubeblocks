# Introduction

KubeBlocks provide the backup and restore function to ensure the safety and reliability of your data. The backup and restore function of KubeBlocks relies on BackupRepo and before using the full backup and restore function, you need to [configure BackupRepo first](./backup-repo.md).

KubeBlocks adopts physical backup as its method, which takes the physical files in a database as the backup object. Further, the backup function of KubeBlocks can be divided into data backup and log backup. You can also customize your backup schedule.

* [Data backup](./data-backup.md): Data backuponly contains full data, which can also be called full backup. Based on different backup methods, data backup can be further divided into backup tool backup and snapshot backup.
  * Backup tool backup: Use the backup tool of the corresponding data product for backup, such as xtrabackup of MySQL and pg_basebackup of PostgreSQL. KubeBlocks supports configuring backup tools for different data products.
  * Snapshot backup: If the data is stored in a cloud disk that supports snapshots, you can create a data backup by snapshots. Snapshot backup is usually faster than backup tool backup, and thus snapshot backup is recommended.

* [Log backup](./log-backup.md): The incremental log files generated by backing up the database, such as binlog of MySQL and WAL of PostgreSQL, can also be called incremental backup. Point-in-time recovery (PITR) relies on log backups.

* [Scheduled backup](./scheduled-backup.md): You can specify the time, backup method, retention time, and other parameters to customize your backup schedule.

As for the restore function, KubeBlocs supports restoring data from the backup set, and PITR.

  * [Restore data from backup set](./restore-data-from-backup-set.md)
  * [PITR](./pitr.md)
