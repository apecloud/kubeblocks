# Handle an exception

If installing KubeBlocks by `kbcli` fails, run preflight checks to find whether your environment meets the requirements of running KubeBlocks and clusters.

```bash
kbcli kubeblocks preflight
```

Add the `--verbose` sub-command to output the details of the preflight checks.

```bash
kbcli kubeblocks preflight --verbose
```

***Result***

There are three types of results:

* `fail`: The environment requirements for installing KubeBlocks are not met, and KubeBlocks can only be installed after these requirements are met. It is required to check these items again and re-run the preflight checks.
* `warn`: The target environment affects the stability and performance of KubeBlocks and clusters, but running KubeBlocks and clusters is not affected, and you can continue the following installation.
* `congratulation`: All checks pass and you can continue the following installation.

# Uninstall KubeBlocks and kbcli

Uninstallation order:

1. Delete your cluster if you have created a cluster.
