# Install kbcli and KubeBlocks on the existed Kubernetes clusters

In the actual environment, it is normal to install kbcli and KubeBlocks on the existed Kubernetes clusters.

## Installation steps

**Step 1. Install kbcli.**

Use the following command.

```bash
curl -fsSL [https://www.kubeblocks.io/installer/install_cli.sh] | bash
```

To customize the version of kbcli, use the following command.

```bash
curl -fsSL [https://kubeblocks.io/installer/install_cli.sh] |bash -s versionnumber
```

**Step 2. Install KubeBlocks with kbcli kubeblocks install command**

The installation command is `kbcli kubeblocks install`, simply running this command will install KubeBlocks on nodes without taints with default namespace `kb-system` .
But in actual scenario, you are recommendend to install KubeBlocks on nodes with taints and customized namespace.

1. Get Kubernetes nodes.

    ```bash
    kubectl get node
    ```

2. Place taints on the selected nodes.

    ```bash
    kubectl taint nodes <nodename> <taint1name>=true:NoSchedule
    ```

3. Install KubeBlocks.

    ```bash
    kbcli kubeblocks install --create-namespace  --namespace <name> --set-json 'tolerations=[ { "key": "taint1name", "operator": "Equal", "effect": "NoSchedule", "value": "true" }, { "key": "taint2name", "operator": "Equal", "effect": "NoSchedule", "value": "true" } ]'
    ```

:::note

When executing of the `kbcli kubeblocks install` command, the `preflight` checks are automatically performed to check the environment. If the current cluster meets the installation requirements, the installation continues. If it does not, the current process is terminated, and an error message is displayed. To force skip the preflight checks, you can add the `--force` flag after the "kbcli kubeblocks install" command.

4. Verify whether KubeBlocks is installed successfully.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pod -n kb-system
    ```

    ***Result***

    When the following pods are `Running`, it means KubeBlocks is installed successfully.

    ```bash
