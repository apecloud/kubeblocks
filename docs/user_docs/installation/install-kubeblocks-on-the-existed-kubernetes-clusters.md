# Install KubeBlocks on the existed Kubernetes clusters

In the actual environment, it is normal to install `kbcli` and KubeBlocks on the existed Kubernetes clusters.

## Installation steps

**Before you start**

Make sure you have kbcli installed, for detailed information, check [Install kbcli](./install-kbcli.md).

**Install KubeBlocks with `kbcli kubeblocks install` command.**

The installation command is `kbcli kubeblocks install`, simply running this command installs KubeBlocks on nodes without taints with default namespace `kb-system`.

But in actual scenarios, you are recommendend to install KubeBlocks on nodes with taints and customized namespace.

1. Get Kubernetes nodes.

    ```bash
    kubectl get node
    ```

2. Place taints on the selected nodes.

    ```bash
    kubectl taint nodes <nodename> <taint1name>=true:NoSchedule
    ```

3. Install KubeBlocks.

    ```bash
    kbcli kubeblocks install --create-namespace  --namespace <name> --set-json 'tolerations=[ { "key": "taint1name", "operator": "Equal", "effect": "NoSchedule", "value": "true" }, { "key": "taint2name", "operator": "Equal", "effect": "NoSchedule", "value": "true" } ]'
    ```

:::note

When executing the `kbcli kubeblocks install` command, the `preflight` checks run automatically to check the environment. If the current cluster meets the installation requirements, the installation continues. If it does not, the current process is terminated, and an error message is displayed. To skip the `preflight` checks, you can add the `--force` flag after the `kbcli kubeblocks install` command.

4. Verify whether KubeBlocks is installed successfully.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pod -n kb-system
    ```

    ***Result***

    When the following pods are `Running`, it means KubeBlocks is installed successfully.

    ```bash
