## Installation steps
**Use Helm to install KubeBlocks**
Run the following command:
```bash
helm repo add kubeblocks https://apecloud.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks \
    --namespace kb-system --create-namespace
````

If you want to install KubeBlocks with custom tolerations, you can use the following command:
```bash
helm install kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks \
    --namespace kb-system --create-namespace \
    --set-json 'tolerations=[ { "key": "control-plane-taint", "operator": "Equal", "effect": "NoSchedule", "value": "true" } ]' \
    --set-json 'dataPlane.tolerations=[{ "key": "data-plane-taint", "operator": "Equal", "effect": "NoSchedule", "value": "true" } ]'
```

## Verify KubeBlocks installation

Run the following command to check whether KubeBlocks is installed successfully.

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=kubeblocks" -w

NAME                                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kubeblocks-846b8878d9-q8g2w                              1/1     Running     0          98s
```

If the operator pods are all `Running`, KubeBlocks has been installed successfully. You can cancel the above command by typing `Ctrl+C`.

:::note

Clusters installed through `helm` need to be deleted using `helm` to avoid resource residue.
