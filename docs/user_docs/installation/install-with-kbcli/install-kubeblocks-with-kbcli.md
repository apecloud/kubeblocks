# Install KubeBlocks with kbcli

The quickest way to try out KubeBlocks is to create a new Kubernetes cluster and install KubeBlocks using the playground. However, production environments are more complex, with applications running in different namespaces and with resource or permission limitations. This document explains how to deploy KubeBlocks on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation steps

The command `kbcli kubeblocks install` installs KubeBlocks in the `kb-system` namespace, or you can use the `--namespace` flag to specify one.

```bash
kbcli kubeblocks install
```


## Verify KubeBlocks installation

Run the following command to check whether KubeBlocks is installed successfully.

```bash
kubectl get pod -n kb-system
```

***Result***

If the following pods are all `Running`, KubeBlocks has been installed successfully.

```bash
