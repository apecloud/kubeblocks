# Install KubeBlocks with kbcli

The quickest way to try out KubeBlocks is to create a new Kubernetes cluster and install KubeBlocks using the playground. However, production environments are more complex, with applications running in different namespaces and with resource or permission limitations. This document explains how to deploy KubeBlocks on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

## Environment preparation

Prepare an accessible Kubernetes cluster with the version 1.22 or above, and this cluster should meet the following requirements.

<table>
	<tr>
	    <th colspan="3">Resource Requirements</th>
	</tr >
	<tr>
	    <td >Control Plane</td>
	    <td colspan="2">It is recommended to create 1 node with 4 cores, 4GB memory and 50GB storage. </td>
	</tr >
	<tr >
	    <td rowspan="4">Data Plane</td>
	    <td> MySQL </td>
	    <td>It is recommended to create at least 3 nodes with 2 cores, 4GB memory and 50GB storage. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td> PostgreSQL </td>
        <td>It is recommended to create at least 2 nodes with 2 cores, 4GB memory and 50GB storage.  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td> Redis </td>
        <td>It is recommended to create at least 2 nodes with 2 cores, 4GB memory and 50GB storage. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td> MongoDB </td>
	    <td>It is recommended to create at least 3 nodes with 2 cores, 4GB memory and 50GB storage. </td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Installation steps

The command `kbcli kubeblocks install` installs KubeBlocks in the `kb-system` namespace, or you can use the `--namespace` flag to specify one.

```bash
kbcli kubeblocks install
```

If you want to install KubeBlocks with a specified version, follow the steps below.

1. View the available versions.

   ```bash
   kbcli kubeblocks list-versions
   ```
   
   To include alpha and beta releases, use:
   ```bash
   kbcli kb list-versions --devel --limit=100
   ```

   Or you can view all available versions in [KubeBlocks Release](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/releases/).
2. Specify a version with `--version` and run the command below.

   ```bash
   kbcli kubeblocks install --version=x.x.x
   ```
  :::note

   By default, when installing KubeBlocks, kbcli installs the corresponding version of KubeBlocks. It's important to ensure the major versions of kbcli and KubeBlocks are the same, if you specify a different version explicitly here.

   For example, you can install kbcli v0.8.3 with KubeBlocks v0.8.1, but using mismatched major versions, such as kbcli v0.8.3 with KubeBlocks v0.9.0, may lead to errors.

## Verify KubeBlocks installation

Run the following command to check whether KubeBlocks is installed successfully.

```bash
kbcli kubeblocks status
```

***Result***

If the KubeBlocks Workloads are all ready, KubeBlocks has been installed successfully.

```bash
KubeBlocks is deployed in namespace: kb-system,version: x.x.x
>
KubeBlocks Workloads:
NAMESPACE   KIND         NAME                           READY PODS   CPU(CORES)   MEMORY(BYTES)   CREATED-AT
