<TabItem value="Helm" label="Helm" default>

Delete all the clusters and resources created before performing the following command, otherwise the uninstallation may not be successful.

```bash
helm uninstall kubeblocks --namespace kb-system
```

Helm does not delete CRD objects. You can delete the ones KubeBlocks created with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get crd -o name | grep kubeblocks.io | xargs kubectl delete
```

You can generate YAMLs from the KubeBlocks chart and uninstall using `kubectl`. Use `--version x.y.z` to specify a version and make sure the uninstalled version is the same as the installed one.
