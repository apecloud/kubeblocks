# KubeBlocks overview

KubeBlocks is an open-source data management platform that greatly simplifies deployment and database operations. It has multiple built-in database engines and provides consistent management experience through `kbcli`, the command line tool of KubeBlocks. KubeBlocks runs on Kubernetes and supports multicloud environments. Any data product can access KubeBlocks in a declarative and configurable way to meet your needs to move to/off clouds and migrate across clouds. KubeBlocks can improve the utilization rate of your cloud resources and decrease the data computing and storage costs through shared instances and resource overcommitment.
