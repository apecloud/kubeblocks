# Delete a MongoDB cluster

## Termination policy

:::note

The termination policy determines how a cluster is deleted. Set the policy when creating a cluster.

:::

| **terminationPolicy**  | **Deleting Operation**                    |
|:--                     | :--                                       |
| `DoNotTerminate`       | `DoNotTerminate` blocks delete operation. |
| `Halt`                 | `Halt` deletes workload resources such as statefulset, deployment workloads but keep PVCs. |
| `Delete`               | `Delete` deletes workload resources and PVCs but keep backups. |
| `WipeOut`              | `WipeOut` deletes workload resources, PVCs and all relevant resources included backups. |

To check the termination policy, execute the following command.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="kbcli" label="kbcli" default>

```bash
kbcli cluster list mycluster -n demo
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

```bash
kubectl get cluster mycluster -n demo
>
NAME        CLUSTER-DEFINITION   VERSION       TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
mycluster   mongodb              mongodb-5.0   Delete               Running   17m
```

## Steps

Run the command below to delete a specified cluster.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="kbcli" label="kbcli" default>

```bash
kbcli cluster delete mycluster -n demo
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

```bash
kubectl delete -n demo cluster mycluster
```

If you want to delete a cluster and its all related resources, you can set the termination policy to `WipeOut`, and then delete the cluster.

```bash
kubectl patch -n demo cluster mycluster -p '{"spec":{"terminationPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"

kubectl delete -n demo cluster mycluster
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
