# Handle an exception
When there is an exception during your operation, you can perform the following procedure to solve it.

## Steps

1. Check the cluster status. Fill in the name of the cluster you want to check and run the command below.
    ```bash
    kbcli cluster list <name>
    ```

    ***Example***

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster list mysql-cluster
    ```
2. Handle the exception according to the status information.

    | **Status**       | **Information** |
    | :---             | :---            |
    | Abnormal         | The cluster can be accessed but exceptions occur in some pods. This might be a mediate status of the operation process and the system recovers automatically without executing any extra operation. Wait until the cluster status is Running. |
    | ConditionsError  | The cluster is normal but an exception occurs to the condition. It might be caused by configuration loss or exception, which further leads to operation failure. Manual recovery is required. |
    | Failed | The cluster cannot be accessed. Check the `status.message` string and get the exception reason. Then manually recover it according to the hints. |
   
    You can check the cluster's status for more information.

## Fallback strategies

If the above operation can not solve the problem, try the following steps:
  - Restart this cluster. If the restart fails, you can delete the pod manually.
  - Roll the cluster status back to the status before changes.
