# Delete a PostgreSQL Cluster

> ***Note:*** 
>
> The termination policy determines how you delete a cluster.

| **terminationPolicy**  | **Deleting Operation**                    |
|:--                     | :--                                       |
| `DoNotTerminate`       | `DoNotTerminate` blocks delete operation. |
| `Halt`                 | `Halt` deletes workload resources such as statefulset, deployment workloads but keep PVCs. |
| `Delete `              | `Delete` delete workload resources and PVCs but keep backups. |
| `WipeOut`              | `WipeOut` deletes workload resources, PVCs and all relevant resources included backups. |

To check the termination policy, execute the following command.

```bash
kbcli cluster list <name>
```

***Example***

```bash
kbcli cluster list pg-cluster
>
