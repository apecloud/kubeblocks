# Scale for a PostgreSQL cluster

You can scale a PostgreSQL cluster in two ways, vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.

:::note

After vertical scaling or horizontal scaling is performed, KubeBlocks automatically matches the appropriate configuration template based on the new specification. This is the KubeBlocks dynamic configuration feature. This feature simplifies the process of configuring parameters, saves time and effort and reduces performance issues caused by incorrect configuration. For detailed instructions, refer to [Configuration](./../configuration/configuration.md).

:::

## Vertical scaling

You can vertically scale a cluster by changing resource requirements and limits (CPU and storage). For example, if you need to change the resource demand from 1C2G to 2C4G, vertical scaling is what you need.

:::note

During the vertical scaling process, all pods restart and the pod role may change after the restarting.

:::

### Before you start

Check whether the cluster status is `Running`. Otherwise, the following operations may fail.

```bash
kbcli cluster list pg-cluster
>
NAME         NAMESPACE   CLUSTER-DEFINITION      VERSION             TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    CREATED-TIME
pg-cluster   default     postgresql              postgresql-14.8.0   Delete               Running   Mar 03,2023 18:00 UTC+0800
```

### Steps

1. Change configuration.

   Configure the parameters `--components`, `--memory`, and `--cpu` and run the command.

   ```bash
   kbcli cluster vscale pg-cluster \
   --components="postgresql" \
   --memory="1Gi" --cpu="1" \
   ```

   - `--components` describes the component name ready for vertical scaling.
   - `--memory` describes the requested and limited size of the component memory.
   - `--cpu` describes the requested and limited size of the component CPU.

2. Validate the vertical scaling.

    Run the command below to check the cluster status to identify the vertical scaling status.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster list pg-cluster
    >
    NAME              NAMESPACE        CLUSTER-DEFINITION            VERSION                TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    CREATED-TIME
    pg-cluster        default          postgresql-cluster            postgresql-14.8.0      Delete               Running   Mar 03,2023 18:00 UTC+0800
    ```

   - STATUS=Updating: it means the vertical scaling is in progress.
   - STATUS=Running: it means the vertical scaling has been applied.
   - STATUS=Abnormal: it means the vertical scaling is abnormal. The reason may be the normal instances number is less than the total instance number or the primary instance is running properly while others are abnormal.
     > To solve the problem, you can check manually to see whether resources are sufficient. If AutoScaling is supported, the system recovers when there are enough resources, otherwise, you can create enough resources and check the result with kubectl describe command.

3. Check whether the corresponding resources change.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster describe pg-cluster
    ```

## Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling changes the amount of pods. For example, you can apply horizontal scaling to scale pods up from three to five. The scaling process includes the backup and restore of data.

### Before you start

Check whether the cluster STATUS is `Running`. Otherwise, the following operations may fail.

```bash
kbcli cluster list pg-cluster
>
NAME              NAMESPACE        CLUSTER-DEFINITION        VERSION                TERMINATION-POLICY        STATUS         CREATED-TIME
pg-cluster        default          postgreql                 postgresql-14.8.0      Delete                    Running        Mar 03,2023 19:29 UTC+0800
```

### Steps

1. Change configuration.

    Configure the parameters `--components` and `--replicas`, and run the command.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster hscale pg-cluster \
    --components="postgresql" --replicas=2
    ```

    - `--components` describes the component name ready for horizontal scaling.
    - `--replicas` describes the replica amount of the specified components.

2. Validate the horizontal scaling operation.

    Check the cluster STATUS to identify the horizontal scaling status.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster list pg-cluster
    ```

    - STATUS=Updating: it means horizontal scaling is in progress.
    - STATUS=Running: it means horizontal scaling has been applied.

3. Check whether the corresponding resources change.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster describe pg-cluster
    ```

### Handle the snapshot exception

If `STATUS=ConditionsError` occurs during the horizontal scaling process, you can find the cause from `cluster.status.condition.message` for troubleshooting.
In the example below, a snapshot exception occurs.

```bash
Status:
  conditions: 
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-04-08T04:20:26Z"
    message: VolumeSnapshot/pg-cluster-postgresql-scaling-dbqgp: Failed to set default snapshot
      class with error cannot find default snapshot class
    reason: ApplyResourcesFailed
    status: "False"
    type: ApplyResources
```

***Reason***

This exception occurs because the `VolumeSnapshotClass` is not configured. This exception can be fixed after configuring `VolumeSnapshotClass`, but the horizontal scaling cannot continue to run. It is because the wrong backup (volumesnapshot is generated by backup) and volumesnapshot generated before still exist. First, delete these two wrong resources and then KubeBlocks re-generates new resources.

***Steps:***

1. Configure the VolumeSnapshotClass by running the command below.

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
    metadata:
      name: csi-aws-vsc
      annotations:
        snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
    driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
    deletionPolicy: Delete
    EOF
    ```

2. Delete the wrong backup (volumesnapshot is generated by backup) and volumesnapshot resources.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete backup -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster
   
    kubectl delete volumesnapshot -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster
    ```

***Result***

The horizontal scaling continues after backup and volumesnapshot are deleted and the cluster restores to running status.
