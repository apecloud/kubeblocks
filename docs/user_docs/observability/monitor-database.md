# Monitor a database

With the built-in database observability, you can observe the database health status and track and measure your database in real-time to optimize database performance. This section shows you how database monitoring tools work with KubeBlocks and how to use the function.

## For Playground/test

KubeBlocks integrates open-source monitoring components, such as Prometheus, AlertManager, and Grafana, by add-ons and adopts the custom `apecloud-otel-collector` to collect the monitoring indicators of databases and host machines. All monitoring add-ons are enabled when KubeBlocks Playground is deployed.

KubeBlock Playground supports the following built-in monitoring add-ons:

* `prometheus`: it includes Prometheus and AlertManager add-ons.
* `grafana`: it includes Grafana monitoring add-ons.
* `alertmanager-webhook-adaptor`: it includes the notification extension add-on and is used to extend the notification capability of AlertManager. Currently, the custom bots of Feishu, DingTalk, and Wechat Enterprise are supported.
* `apecloud-otel-collecotr`: it is used to collect the indicators of databases and the host machine.

1. View all built-in add-ons and make sure the monitoring add-ons are enabled.

   ```bash
   # View all add-ons supported
   kbcli addon list
   ...
   grafana                        Helm   Enabled                   true                                                                                    
   alertmanager-webhook-adaptor   Helm   Enabled                   true                                                                                    
   prometheus                     Helm   Enabled    alertmanager   true 
   ...
   ```

2. View the dashboard list.

   ```bash
   kbcli dashboard list
   >
   NAME                                 NAMESPACE   PORT    CREATED-TIME
   kubeblocks-grafana                   kb-system   13000   Jul 24,2023 11:38 UTC+0800
   kubeblocks-prometheus-alertmanager   kb-system   19093   Jul 24,2023 11:38 UTC+0800
   kubeblocks-prometheus-server         kb-system   19090   Jul 24,2023 11:38 UTC+0800
   ```

3. Open and view the web console of a monitoring dashboard. For example,

   ```bash
   kbcli dashboard open kubeblocks-grafana
   ```

## For production environment

In the production environment, it is highly recommended to build your monitoring system or purchase a third-party monitoring service.

### Enable monitoring function

KubeBlocks provides an add-on, `victoria-metrics-agent`, to push the monitoring data to a third-party monitoring system compatible with the Prometheus Remote Write protocol. Compared with the native Prometheus, [vmgent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) is lighter and supports the horizontal extension.

1. Enable data push.

   You just need to provide the endpoint which supports the Prometheus Remote Write protocol and multiple endpoints can be supported. Refer to the tutorials of your third-party monitoring system for how to get an endpoint.

   The following examples show how to enable data push by different options.

   ```bash
   # The default option. You only need to provide an endpoint with no verification.
   # Endpoint example: http://localhost:8428/api/v1/write
   kbcli addon enable victoria-metrics-agent --set remoteWriteUrls={http://<remoteWriteUrl>:<port>/<remote write path>}
   ```

   ```bash
   # Basic Auth
   kbcli addon enable victoria-metrics-agent --set "extraArgs.remoteWrite.basicAuth.username=<your username>,remoteWrite.basicAuth.password=<your password>,remoteWriteUrls={http://<remoteWriteUrl>:<port>/<remote write path>}"
   ```

   ```bash
   # TLS
   kbcli addon enable victoria-metrics-agent --set "extraArgs.tls=true,extraArgs.tlsCertFile=<path to certifle>,extraArgs.tlsKeyFile=<path to keyfile>,remoteWriteUrls={http://<remoteWriteUrl>:<port>/<remote write path>}"
   ```

   ```bash
   # AWS SigV4
   kbcli addon enable victoria-metrics-agent --set "extraArgs.remoteWrite.aws.region=<your AMP region>,extraArgs.remoteWrite.aws.accessKey=<your accessKey>,extraArgs.remoteWrite.aws.secretKey=<your secretKey>,remoteWriteUrls={http://<remoteWriteUrl>:<port>/<remote write path>}"
   ```

2. (Optional) Horizontally scale the `victoria-metrics-agent` add-on.

   When the amount of database instances continues to increase, a single-node vmagent becomes the bottleneck. This problem can be solved by scaling vmagent. The multiple-node vmagent automatically divides the task of data collection according to the Hash strategy.

   ```bash
   kbcli addon enable victoria-metrics-agent --replicas <replica count> --set remoteWriteUrls={http://<remoteWriteUrl>:<port>/<remote write path>}
   ```

3. (Optional) Disable the `victoria-metrics-agent` add-on.

   ```bash
   kbcli addon disable victoria-metrics-agent
   ```

### Integrate Dashboard and Alert Rules

Kubeblocks provides Grafana Dashboards and Prometheus AlertRules for mainstream engines, which you can obtain from [the repository](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks-mixin), or convert and customize according to your needs.

For the importing method, refer to the tutorials of your third-party monitoring service.

## Enable the monitoring function for a database

The monitoring function is enabled by default when a database is created. The open-source or customized Exporter is injected after the monitoring function is enabled. This Exporter can be found by Prometheus server automatically and scrape monitoring indicators at regular intervals. You can change mysql as `postgresql`, `mongodb`, `redis` to create a cluster of other database engines.

* For a new cluster, run the command below to create a database cluster.

    ```bash
    # Search the cluster definition
    kbcli clusterdefinition list 

    # Create a cluster
    kbcli cluster create mysql <clustername> 
    ```

:::note

You can change `--monitoring-interval` as `0` to disable the monitoring function but it is not recommended.

```bash
kbcli cluster create mysql mycluster --monitoring-interval=0
```

:::

* For the existing cluster with the monitoring function disabled, you can update it to enable the monitor function by the `update` command.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster update mycluster --monitoring-interval=15s
    ```

You can view the dashboard of the corresponding cluster via Grafana Web Console. For more detailed information, see the [Grafana dashboard documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/).
