# Try out KubeBlocks in 5 minutes on laptop

This guide walks you through the quickest way to get started with KubeBlocks, demonstrating how to create a demo environment (Playground) with one command.

## Before you start

Meet the following requirements for a smooth user experience:

* Minimum system requirements:
  * CPU: 4 cores, use `sysctl hw.physicalcpu` command to check CPU;
  * RAM: 4 GB, use `top -d` command to check memory.

* Make sure the following tools are installed on your laptop:
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): v20.10.5 (runc â‰¥ v1.0.0-rc93) or above;
  * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl): it is used to interact with Kubernetes clusters;
  * [kbcli](./../installation/install-kbcli.md): it is used for the interaction between Playground and KubeBlocks.

## Initialize Playground

***Steps:***

1. Install Playground.

   ```bash
   kbcli playground init
   ```

   This command:
   1. Creates a Kubernetes cluster in the container with [K3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/).
   2. Deploys KubeBlocks in the K3d cluster.
   3. Creates a standalone MySQL cluster.

2. Check the MySQL cluster repeatedly until the status becomes `Running`. 

   ```bash
   kbcli cluster list
   ```

   **Result:**

   You just created a cluster named `mycluster` in the default namespace. You can find the user guide under the installation success tip. View this guide again by running `kbcli playground init -h`.

## Try KubeBlocks with Playground

You can explore KubeBlocks, by referring to [Describe a MySQL cluster](#describe-a-mysql-cluster), [Access a MySQL cluster](#access-a-mysql-cluster), [Observe a MySQL cluster](#observe-a-mysql-cluster), and [High availability](#high-availability-of-mysql). Go through the following instructions to try basic features of KubeBlocks.

:::note

Playground does not support volume expansion, backup, and restore functions.

### Describe a MySQL cluster

***Steps:***

1. View the database cluster list.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster list
    ```

2. View the details of a specified database cluster, such as `STATUS`, `Endpoints`, `Topology`, `Images`, and `Events`.

    ```bash
    kbcli cluster describe mycluster
    ```

### Access a MySQL cluster

**Option 1.** Connect database from container network.

Wait until the status of this cluster is `Running`, then run `kbcli cluster connect` to access a specified database cluster. For example,

```bash
kbcli cluster connect mycluster
```

**Option 2.** Connect database from host network.

***Steps:***

1. Get Credentials.
   ```bash
   kbcli cluster connect --show-example --client=cli mycluster
   ```
3. Run `port-forward`.

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/mycluster-mysql 3306:3306
   >
   Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3306 -> 3306
   Forwarding from [::1]:3306 -> 3306

3. Open another terminal tab to connect the database cluster.

   ```bash
   mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -paiImelyt
   >
   ...
   Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

   5 rows in set (0.02 sec)
   ```

### Observe a MySQL cluster

KubeBlocks supports complete observability capabilities. This section demonstrates the monitoring function of KubeBlocks.

***Steps:***

1. Open the grafana dashboard.

   ```bash
   kbcli dashboard open kubeblocks-grafana
   ```

   **Result:**

   A monitoring page on Grafana website is loaded automatically after the command is executed.

2. Click the Dashboard icon on the left bar and monitoring panels show on the page.
   ![Dashboards](./../../img/quick_start_dashboards.png)
3. Click **General** -> **MySQL** to monitor the status of the MySQL cluster.
   ![MySQL_panel](./../../img/quick_start_mysql_panel.png)

### High availability of MySQL

This guide shows a simple failure simulation to show you the failure recovery capability of MySQL.

#### Delete the Standalone MySQL cluster

Delete the Standalone MySQL cluster before trying out high availability.

```bash
kbcli cluster delete mycluster
```

#### Create a Raft MySQL cluster

You can use `kbcli` to create a Raft MySQL cluster. The following is an example of creating a Raft MySQL cluster with default configurations.

```bash
kbcli cluster create --cluster-definition='apecloud-mysql' --set replicas=3
```

#### Simulate leader pod failure recovery

In this example, delete the leader pod to simulate a failure.

***Steps:***

1. Make sure the newly created cluster is `Running`.

   ```bash
   kbcli cluster list
   ```

2. Find the leader pod name in `Topology`. In this example, the leader pod's name is maple05-mysql-1.

   ```bash
   kbcli cluster describe maple05
   >

3. Delete the leader pod.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod maple05-mysql-1
   >
   pod "maple05-mysql-1" deleted
   ```

4. Connect to the Raft MySQL cluster. It can be accessed within seconds.

   ```bash
   kbcli cluster connect maple05
   >
   Connect to instance maple05-mysql-2: out of maple05-mysql-2(leader), maple05-mysql-1(follower), maple05-mysql-0(follower)

#### Demonstrate availability failure by NON-STOP NYAN CAT (for fun)

The above example uses `kbcli cluster connect` to test availability, in which the changes are not obvious to see.

NON-STOP NYAN CAT is a demo application to observe how the database cluster exceptions affect actual businesses. Animations and real-time key information display provided by NON-STOP NYAN CAT can directly show the availability influences of database services.

***Steps:***

1. Install the NYAN CAT demo application.

   ```bash
   kbcli addon enable nyancat
   ```

   <details>

   <summary>Expected output</summary>

   ```bash
   addon.extensions.kubeblocks.io/nyancat enabled   
   ```

   </details>

2. Check the NYAN CAT add-on status and when its status is `Enabled`, this application is ready.

   ```bash
   kbcli addon list | grep nyancat 
   ```

3. Open the web page.

   ```bash
   kbcli dashboard open kubeblocks-nyancat
   ```

4. Open another terminal tab and delete the leader pod. Then view the influences on the Raft MySQL cluster through the NYAN CAT page.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod maple05-mysql-1
   ```

   ![NYAN CAT](./../../img/quick_start_nyan_cat.png)

5. Uninstall the NYAN CAT demo application after your trial.

   ```bash
   kbcli addon disable nyancat
   ```

## Destroy Playground

Destroying Playground cleans up resources and data:

* Delete all KubeBlocks database clusters.
* Uninstall KubeBlocks.
* Delete the Kubernetes cluster created by K3d.

Destroy Playground.

```bash
kbcli playground destroy
```
