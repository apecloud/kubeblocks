# Backup and restore for MySQL standalone 
This section shows how to use kbcli to back up and restore a MySQL standalone instance.

***Before you start***

- Prepare a clean EKS cluster, and install ebs csi driver plug-in, with at least one node and the memory of each node is not less than 4GB.
- Install kubectl to ensure that you can connect to the EKS cluster 
- Install kbcli.
   ```
   curl -fsSL http://161.189.136.182:8000/apecloud/kubeblocks/install_cli.sh |bash
   ```

***Steps:***

1. Install kubeblocks and enable snapshot backup.
Install KubeBlocks and enable the snapshot controller plugin.
   ```
   kbcli kubeblocks install --set snapshot-controller.enabled=true
   ```
   To enable the snapshot controller plugin after installation.
   ```
   kbcli kubeblocks upgrade --set snapshot-controller.enabled=true
   ```
   Since your kubectl is already connected to the EKS cluster, this command installs the latest version of KubeBlocks in your EKS environment.

   Verify the installation with the following command.
   ```
   kubectl get pod
   ```

   The pod with kubeblocks-snapshot-controller is shown. See the information below.
   ```
   NAME                                              READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE
   kubeblocks-5c8b9d76d6-m984n                       1/1     Running            0             9m
   kubeblocks-snapshot-controller-6b4f656c99-zgq7g   1/1     Running            0             9m
   ```
2. Configure EKS to support the snapshot function.
The backup is realized by the volume snapshot function, you need to configure EKS to support the snapshot function.
- Configure storage class of snapshot (the assigned ebs volume is gp3).
  ```
  kubectl create -f - <<EOF
  kind: StorageClass
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: ebs-sc
    annotations:
      storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
  parameters:
    csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs
    type: gp3
  allowVolumeExpansion: true
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
  EOF
  
  kubectl patch sc/gp2 -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "false"}}}'
  ```
- Configure default snapshot volumesnapshot class
  ```
  cat <<"EOF" > snapshot_class.yaml
  apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
  metadata:
    name: csi-aws-vsc
    annotations:
      snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
  deletionPolicy: Delete
  EOF
  
  kubectl create -f snapshot_class.yaml
  ```
3. Create a MySQL cluster. 
   In this section, the cluster created is mysql-cluster.
   ```
   kbcli cluster create mysql-cluster --cluster-definition='apecloud-mysql'
   ```
4. Insert test data to test backup.
   Connect to the MySQL cluster created in the previous steps and insert a piece of data. See the example below.
   ```
   kbcli cluster connect mysql-cluster
   
   create database if not exists demo;
   create table if not exists demo.msg(id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, msg text, time datetime, PRIMARY KEY (id));
   insert into demo.msg (msg, time) value ("hello", now());
   select * from demo.msg;
   ```
  
5. Create a snapshot backup.
    ```
   kbcli cluster backup mysql-cluster
    ```
6. Check the backup.
   ```
   kbcli cluster list-backups
   ```
7. Restore to a new cluster.
   Copy the backup name to the clipboard, and restore to the new cluster. 
   > ***Note:*** 
   > 
   > You do not need to specify other parameters for creating an cluster. The restoration automatically reads the parameters of the source cluster, including specification, disk size, etc., and create a new MySQL cluster with the same specifications. 

   Execute the following command.
   ```
   kbcli cluster restore mysql-new-from-snapshot --backup backup-default-mysql-cluster-20221124113440
   ```
8. Verify the data restored.
   Execute the following command to verify the data restored.
   ```
   kbcli cluster connect mysql-new-from-snapshot
   select * from demo.msg;
   ```
9. Delete the ApeCloud MySQL cluster and clean up the backup.
   > ***Note:***
   > 
   > Expense incurred when you have snapshots on the cloud. So it is recommended to delete the test cluster.
  
   Delete MySQL cluster with the following command.
   ```
   kbcli cluster delete mysql-cluster
   kbcli cluster delete mysql-new-from-snapshot
   ```
   Delete the backup specified.

   ```
   kbcli cluster delete-backup mysql-cluster --name backup-default-mysql-cluster-20221124113440 
   ```
   Delete all backups with `mysql-cluster`.
   ```
   kbcli cluster delete mysql-cluster
   ```
