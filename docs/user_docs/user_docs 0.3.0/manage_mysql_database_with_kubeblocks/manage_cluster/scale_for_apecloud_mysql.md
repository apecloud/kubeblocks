# Scale for ApeCloud MySQL
You can scale ApeCloud MySQL DB instances in two ways, horizontal scaling and vertical scaling. 

## Vertical scaling
You can vertically scale a cluster by changing resource requirements and limits (CPU and storage). For example, if you need to change the resource demand from 1C2G to 2C4G, vertical scaling is what you need.

> ***Note:*** 
> 
> During the vertical scaling process, all pods restart in the order of learner -> follower -> leader and the leader pod may change after the restarting.

***Before you start***

Run the command below to check whether the cluster STATUS is Running. Otherwise, the following operations may fail.
```
kbcli cluster list NAME
```

***Example***

```
$ kbcli cluster list mysql-cluster
NAME                 NAMESPACE        CLUSTER-DEFINITION        VERSION                TERMINATION-POLICY        STATUS         CREATED-TIME
mysql-cluster        default          apecloud-mysql            ac-mysql-8.0.30        Delete                    Running        Jan 29,2023 14:29 UTC+0800
```
***Steps:***

1. Change configuration. There are 3 ways to apply vertical scaling.
   
   **Option 1.** (Recommended) Use `kbcli`.
   
   Configure the parameters `component-names`, `requests`, and `limits` and run the command.
   
   ***Example***
   
   ```
   $ kbcli cluster vertical-scale mysql-cluster \
   --component-names="mysql" \
   --requests.memory="2Gi" --requests.cpu="1" \
   --limits.memory="4Gi" --limits.cpu="2"
   ```
   - `component-names` describes the component name ready for vertical scaling.
   - `requests` describes the minimum amount of computing resources required. If `requests` is omitted for a container, it uses the `limits` value if `limits` is explicitly specified, otherwise uses an implementation-defined value. For more details, see [Resource Management for Pods and Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).
   - `--limits` describes the maximum amount of computing resources allowed. For more details, see [Resource Management for Pods and Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
  
   **Option 2.** Create an OpsRequest.
  
   Run the command below to apply an OpsRequest to the specified cluster. Configure the parameters according to your needs.
   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
   kind: OpsRequest
   metadata:
     name: ops-vertical-scaling
   spec:
     clusterRef: mysql-cluster
     type: VerticalScaling 
     verticalScaling:
     - componentName: mysql
       requests:
         memory: "2Gi"
         cpu: "1000m"
       limits:
         memory: "4Gi"
         cpu: "2000m"
   EOF
   ```
  
   **Option 3.** Change the YAML file of the cluster.

   Change the configuration of `spec.components.resources` in the YAML file. `spec.components.resources` controls the requirement and limit of resources and changing them triggers a vertical scaling. 

   ***Example***

   ```
   apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Cluster
   metadata:
     name: mysql-01
     namespace: default
   spec:
     clusterDefinitionRef: apecloud-mysql
     clusterVersionRef: ac-mysql-8.0.30
     components:
     - name: mysql
       type: mysql
       replicas: 1
       resources: # Change the values of resources.
         requests:
           memory: "2Gi"
           cpu: "1000m"
         limits:
           memory: "4Gi"
           cpu: "2000m"
       volumeClaimTemplates:
       - name: data
         spec:
           accessModes:
             - ReadWriteOnce
           resources:
             requests:
               storage: 1Gi
     terminationPolicy: Halt
   ```
  
2. Validate the vertical scaling.
    Run the command below to check the cluster status to identify the vertical scaling status.
    ```
    kbcli cluster list NAME
    ```

    ***Example***

    ```
    $ kbcli cluster list mysql-cluster
    NAME                 NAMESPACE        CLUSTER-DEFINITION        VERSION                TERMINATION-POLICY        STATUS          CREATED-TIME
    mysql-cluster        default          apecloud-mysql            ac-mysql-8.0.30        Delete                    Updating        Jan 29,2023 14:29 UTC+0800
    ```
   - STATUS=Running: means the vertical scaling operation is applied.
   - STATUS=Updating: means the vertical scaling is in progress.
   - STATUS=Abnormal: means the vertical scaling is abnormal. The reason may be the normal instances number is less than the total instance number or the leader instance is running properly while others are abnormal. 
     > To solve the problem, you can check manually to see whether resource is sufficient. If AutoScaling is supported, the system recovers when there is enough resource, otherwise, create enough resource and check with `kubectl describe` command.

## Horizontal scaling
Horizontal scaling changes the amount of pods. For example, you can apply a horizontal scaling to scale up from three pods to five pods. The scaling process includes the backup and restore of data.
The process of the horizontal scaling:

1. Create a snapshot for the leader pod.
2. Create the PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) required by the new pod by the snapshot.
3. Mount the new pod on PVC.
4. Clean up the resources, such as backup and snapshot, created during the scaling process.
   The existing pods do not restart during the horizontal scaling process.
   The scale-down operation immediately deletes the pods that are no longer needed and delete their corresponding PVC after 30 minutes. If another scale-up operation is triggered within the waiting 30 minutes, the PVC that has not been deleted is used for storage.

***Before you start***

Run the command below to check whether the cluster STATUS is `Running`. Otherwise, the following operations may fail.

  ```
  kbcli cluster list NAME
  ```

***Example***

```
$ kbcli cluster list mysql-cluster
NAME                 NAMESPACE        CLUSTER-DEFINITION        VERSION                TERMINATION-POLICY        STATUS         CREATED-TIME
mysql-cluster        default          apecloud-mysql            ac-mysql-8.0.30        Delete                    Running        Jan 29,2023 14:29 UTC+0800
```

***Steps:***

1. Change configuration. There are 3 ways to apply horizontal scaling.
   
   **Option 1.** (Recommended) Use `kbcli`.
   
   Configure the parameters `component-names` and `replicas`, and run the command.

   ***Example***

   ```
   kbcli cluster horizontal-scale mysql-cluster \
   --component-names="mysql" --replicas=3
   ```
   - `component-names` describes the component name ready for vertical scaling.
   - `replicas` describe the replicas with the specified components.

   **Option 2.** Create an OpsRequest.

   Run the command below to apply an OpsRequest to the specified cluster. Configure the parameters according to your needs.
   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
   kind: OpsRequest
   metadata:
     name: ops-horizontal-scaling
   spec:
     clusterRef: mysql-01
     type: HorizontalScaling
     horizontalScaling:
     - componentName: mysql
       replicas: 3
   EOF
   ```

   **Option 3.** Change the YAML file of the cluster.

   Change the configuration of `spec.components.replicas` in the YAML file. `spec.components.replicas` stand for the pod amount and changing this value triggers a horizontal scaling of a cluster. 

   ***Example***

   ```
   apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Cluster
   metadata:
    apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Cluster
   metadata:
     name: mysql-cluster
     namespace: default
   spec:
     clusterDefinitionRef: apecloud-mysql
     clusterVersionRef: ac-mysql-8.0.30
     components:
     - name: mysql
       type: mysql
       replicas: 1 # Change the pod amount.
       volumeClaimTemplates:
       - name: data
         spec:
           accessModes:
             - ReadWriteOnce
           resources:
             requests:
               storage: 1Gi
    terminationPolicy: Halt
   ```
2. Validate the horizontal scaling operation
Run the command below to check the cluster STATUS to identify the horizontal scaling status.
   ```
   kbcli cluster list mysql-cluster
   ```

  - STATUS=Updating: means horizontal scaling is being applied.
  - STATUS=Running: means horizontal scaling is applied.

**Handle the snapshot exception**

If `STATUS=ConditionsError` occurs during the horizontal scaling process, you can find the cause from `cluster.status.condition.message` for troubleshooting.
In the example below, a snapshot exception occurs.
```
Status:
  conditions: 
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-02-08T04:20:26Z"
    message: VolumeSnapshot/mysql-01-mysql-scaling-dbqgp: Failed to set default snapshot
      class with error cannot find default snapshot class
    reason: ApplyResourcesFailed
    status: "False"
    type: ApplyResources
```
***Reason***

This exception occurs because the `VolumeSnapshotClass` is not configured. This exception can be fixed after configuring `VolumeSnapshotClass`, but the horizontal scaling cannot continue to run. It is because the wrong backup (volumesnapshot is generated by backup) and volumesnapshot generated before still exist. Delete these two wrong resources and then KubeBlocks re-generates new resources.

***Steps:*** 

1. Configure the VolumeSnapshotClass by running the command below.
   ```
   $ kubectl create -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
   metadata:
     name: csi-aws-vsc
     annotations:
       snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
   driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
   deletionPolicy: Delete
   EOF
   ```

2. Delete the wrong backup (volumesnapshot is generated by backup) and volumesnapshot resources.
   ```
   $ kubectl delete backup -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mysql-01
   
   $ kubectl delete volumesnapshot -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mysql-01
   ```

***Result***

The horizontal scaling continues after backup and volumesnapshot are deleted and the cluster restores to running status.
