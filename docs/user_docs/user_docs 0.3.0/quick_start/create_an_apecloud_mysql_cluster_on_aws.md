# Create an ApeCloud MySQL cluster on AWS

This guide introduces how to use KubeBlocks to create an ApeCloud MySQL cluster based on the Paxos consensus protocol within 5 minutes under the EKS environment.

> ***Caution:*** 
> 
> Running a database cluster on the cloud causes fees. Delete the resources created during the deploying process after operations.

## Before you start

1. EKS environment is required and it includes at least three replicas.
2. Install MySQL client on your local host because KubeBlocks communicates with the deployed MySQL clusters by calling MySQL client. Refer to [Installing MySQL Shell on macOS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install-macos-quick.html) for details.
3. `kubectl` is required and can connect to the EKS cluster. For installing `kubectl`, refer to [Install and Set Up kubectl on macOS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/) for details.

## Step 1. Install `kbcli`

1. Run the command below to install `kbcli`. `kbcli` can run on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://kubeblocks.io/installer/install_cli.sh | bash
   ```
   > ***Note:*** 
   > 
   > Please try again if a time-out exception occurs during installation. It may relate to your network condition.
2. Run the command below to check the version and verify whether `kbcli` is installed successfully.
   ```bash
   kbcli version
   ```
3. Run the command below to uninstall `kbcli` if you want to delete kbcli after your trial.
   ```bash
   sudo rm /usr/local/bin/kbcli
   ```

## Step 2. Install KubeBlocks

1. Run the command below to install KubeBlock.
   ```bash
   kbcli kubeblocks install --set loadbalancer.enabled=true
   ```

   | Option | Usage |
   | :--    | :--   |
   | `--set snapshot-controller.enabled` | `--set snapshot-controller.enabled=true` option enables KubeBlocks to use EBS snapshot for backup and restore and this option is required for the deployment on AWS.|
   | `--set loadbalancer.enabled` | To enable a node outside the Kubernetes cluster (the node should be within the same VPC) to visit the database cluster created by KubeBlocks, use `--set loadbalancer.enabled=true` option as the above command does. For more details on installation, refer to [Install/Uninstall kbcli and KubeBlocks](../install_kbcli_kubeblocks/install_and_unistall_kbcli_and_kubeblocks.md). |
   | `--namespace` | If you want to specify a namespace for KubeBlocks, use the global command-line option `--namespace` or the abbreviated `-n` to name your namespace and configure `--create-namespace` as `true` to create a namespace if it does not exist. For example, <br />```kbcli kubeblocks install -n kubeblocks --create-namespace=true``` |
   | `--create-namespace` | Use `create-namespace` to specify whether to create a namespace if it does not exist.|
   
   > ***Note:***
   > 
   > For global command line options, run `kbcli options` to list all options (applies to all commands). 

   ***Result***

   This command installs the latest version in your Kubernetes environment since your `kubectl` can connect to your Kubernetes clusters.

2. Run the YAML files below to apply for EBS resources and enable backup.
   * Apply for EBS resources:
      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
      kind: StorageClass
      apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
      metadata:
       name: gp3
       annotations:
       storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
      allowVolumeExpansion: true
      provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
      volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
      parameters:
       type: gp3
      EOF
      ```
   * Enable backup:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
     apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
     kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
     metadata:
       name: csi-aws-vsc
       annotations:
         snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
     driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
     deletionPolicy: Delete
     EOF
     ```
3. Run the command below to verify whether KubeBlocks is installed successfully.
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod
   ```

   ***Result***

   Four pods starting with `kubeblocks` are displayed. For example,
   ```
   NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   kubeblocks-7d4c6fd684-9hjh7                           1/1     Running   0          3m33s
   kubeblocks-grafana-b765d544f-wj6c6                    3/3     Running   0          3m33s
   kubeblocks-prometheus-alertmanager-7c558865f5-hsfn5   2/2     Running   0          3m33s
   kubeblocks-prometheus-server-5c89c8bc89-mwrx7         2/2     Running   0          3m33s
   ```
4. Run the command below to uninstall KubeBlocks if you want to delete KubeBlocks after your trial.
   ```bash
   kbcli kubeblocks uninstall
   ```

## Step 3. Create an ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group

> ***Caution:***
> 
> * Configure the pod memory and CPU kernel amount of your EKS cluster by running `export KBCLI_CLUSTER_DEFAULT_MEMORY=nGi` and `export KBCLI_CLUSTER_DEFAULT_CPU=n`. If there are not three replicas that exceed the values of memory and CPU, creating a MySQL cluster may fail.
> * KubeBlocks applies for a new EBS volume of 10 Gi (the default storage size), which causes extra fees. You can adjust it by running `export KBCLI_CLUSTER_DEFAULT_STORAGE=nGi`. Delete this EBS volume after your trial.

1. Run the command below to create an ApeCloud MySQL cluster. 
   For more details on options, refer to [`kbcli` cluster create options description](../manage_mysql_database_with_kubeblocks/manage_cluster/create_and_connect_a_mysql_cluster.md#create-a-mysql-cluster).

   ```bash
   export KBCLI_CLUSTER_DEFAULT_REPLICAS=3
   export KBCLI_CLUSTER_DEFAULT_MEMORY=1Gi
   export KBCLI_CLUSTER_DEFAULT_CPU=2

   kbcli cluster create --cluster-definition=apecloud-mysql
   ```

   ***Result***

   An ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group with 10 Gi of storage is created. 

2. Run the command below to view the created cluster.
   ```bash
   kbcli cluster list
   ```

## Step 4. Connect to the ApeCloud MySQL cluster

1. It takes several minutes to create a cluster. Run `kbcli cluster list` to check the cluster status and when the cluster status is `Running`, the cluster has been created. 
2. Run the command below to connect to the leader pod of ApeCloud MySQL. (The leader pod is called leaseholder in other databases.)
   ```bash
   kbcli cluster connect maple05
   ```

After connecting to the cluster, you can operate the created MySQL cluster as you do in the MySQL client.

If you want to connect to the MySQL cluster using MySQL client or your stress test tool, 
1. Run the command below to get the IP and port of this cluster first. 
   ```bash
   kbcli cluster describe maple05
   ```
2. Find the Endpoints information in the result.
   ```
   Endpoints:
   COMPONENT          MODE             INTERNAL                  EXTERNAL        
   replicasets        ReadWrite        10.100.197.10:3306        <none>
   ```

The ApeCloud MySQL cluster provides high availability to ensure RPO=0. When a failure occurs to the MySQL leader pod, other MySQL pods can be elected as the succeeding leader based on the Paxos protocol. The connection address does not change even though the leader pod changes.

## Step 5. Delete the ApeCloud MySQL cluster
Run the command below to delete the ApeCloud MySQL cluster.
```bash
kbcli cluster delete maple05
```
