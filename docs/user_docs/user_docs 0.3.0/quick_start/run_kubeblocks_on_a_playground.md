# Run KubeBlocks on a playground
This guide uses one `kbcli` command to create a KubeBlocks demo environment (a playground) quickly on your local host.
With a playground, you can try KubeBlocks and some ApeCloud MySQL features. This guide introduces how to install a playground and how to try KubeBlocks on the playground.

***Before you start***

Ensure the following requirements are met so the playground and other functions can run fluently.

* Minimum system requirements:
  * CPU: 4 cores
  * RAM: 4 GB

* The following tools are installed on your local host.
  * Docker: It acts as a workload environment and the version should be v20.10.5 (runc ≥ v1.0.0-rc93) or above. For installation details, refer to [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  * `kbcli`: It is the command line tool of KubeBlocks and is used for the interaction between the playground and KubeBlocks. Follow the steps below to install `kbcli`.
    1. Run the command below to install `kbcli`.
         ```bash
         curl -fsSL https://kubeblocks.io/installer/install_cli.sh | bash
         ```
    2. Run `kbcli version` to check the `kbcli` version and make sure `kbcli` is installed successfully.
    3. Run the command below to uninstall `kbcli` if you want to delete `kbcli` after your trial.
         ```bash
         sudo rm /usr/local/bin/kbcli
         ```
  * `kubectl`: It is used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. For installation details, refer to [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

## Install a playground

Run the command below to install a playground.

```bash
kbcli playground init
```

How this command works on your local host:
1. Create a Kubernetes cluster in the container by using [K3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/).
2. Deploy KubeBlocks in this Kubernetes cluster.
3. Create an ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group by KubeBlocks.

***Result***

You can see the following information indicating relevant modules have been installed successfully.
```
Create playground k3d cluster: kubeblocks-playground OK
Generate kubernetes config /Users/${username}/.kube/kubeblocks-playground OK
⣟  Install KubeBlocks 0.3.2
Install KubeBlocks 0.3.2                 OK
Create cluster mycluster (ClusterDefinition: apecloud-mysql, ClusterVersion: ac-mysql-8.0.30) OK

KubeBlocks playground init SUCCESSFULLY!
Cluster "mycluster" has been CREATED!
```

You can find the user guide of the playground under the installation success tip. View this guide again by running `kbcli playground guide`.
```
1. Basic commands for cluster:

  export KUBECONFIG=/Users/${username}/.kube/kubeblocks-playground

  kbcli cluster list                     # list database cluster and check its status
  kbcli cluster describe mycluster       # get cluster information

2. Connect to database

  kbcli cluster connect mycluster

3. View the Grafana:

  kbcli dashboard open kubeblocks-grafana

4. Uninstall Playground:

  kbcli playground destroy

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To view this guide: kbcli playground guide
To get more help: kbcli help

Use "kbcli [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Following the instructions in "1. Basic commands for cluster", switch to the Kubernetes local cluster created by the playground by running `export KUBECONFIG=xxx` to start your trip on KubeBlocks and ApeCloud MySQL.

> ***Caution:***  
> 
> Running `export KUBECONFIG` is a necessity for using KubeBlocks and ApeCloud MySQL.

## Run your playground

The playground guide includes three sections, namely [Basic functions](#basic-functions), [Observability](#observability), and [High availability](#high-availability-of-apecloud-mysql). Refer to [Feature list](../introduction_and_feature_list/feature_list.md) to explore more KubeBlocks features and you can try the full features of KubeBlocks in a standard Kubernetes cluster.

### Basic functions

KubeBlocks supports the complete life cycle management of a database cluster and follows the best practice of application development. The following instructions demonstrate the basic features of KubeBlocks. For the full feature set, refer to [KubeBlocks Documentation](../../../../docs) for details.

> ***Note:***
>
> The local host does not support volume expansion, backup, and restore functions.

#### Create an ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group

The playground creates an ApeCloud-MySQL Paxos group by default. You can also use `kbcli` to create a new cluster. The following is an example of creating an ApeCloud-MySQL Paxos group of 1 vCPU and 1 GiB of memory.

```bash
export KBCLI_CLUSTER_DEFAULT_REPLICAS=3

kbcli cluster create --cluster-definition='apecloud-mysql' 

```

#### View an ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group

***Steps:***

1. Run `kbcli cluster list` to view the database cluster list.
    ```bash
    kbcli cluster list
    >
    NAME     	NAMESPACE	CLUSTER-DEFINITION	VERSION        	TERMINATION-POLICY	STATUS 	CREATED-TIME
    mycluster	default  	apecloud-mysql    	ac-mysql-8.0.30	WipeOut           	Running	Jan 31,2023 16:06 UTC+0800
    maple05  	default  	apecloud-mysql    	ac-mysql-8.0.30	Delete            	Running	Jan 31,2023 16:17 UTC+0800 
    ```

2. Run `kbcli cluster describe` to view the details of a specified database cluster, such as `STATUS`, `Endpoints`, `Topology`, `Images`, and `Events`.
    ```bash
    kbcli cluster describe maple05
    >
    Name: mycluster  Created Time: Jan 30,2023 17:33 UTC+0800
    NAMESPACE  CLUSTER-DEFINITION  VERSION          STATUS  TERMINATION-POLICY

    ```

#### Access an ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group

**Option 1.** Use a command line tool.

If a database cluster has been created and its status is `Running`, run `kbcli cluster connect` to access a specified database cluster. For example, 
```bash
kbcli cluster connect maple05
>
Connect to instance maple05-mysql-0: out of maple05-mysql-0(leader), maple05-mysql-1(follower), maple05-mysql-2(follower)
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 25
Server version: 8.0.30 WeSQL Server - GPL, Release 5, Revision d6b8719

owners.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

You can also run the command below to access a cluster by MySQL client.
```bash
kbcli cluster connect --show-example --client=cli maple05
# cluster maple05 does not have public endpoints, you can run following command and connect cluster from local host
kubectl port-forward service/maple05-mysql 3306:3306

# mysql client connection example
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -paiImelyt


kubectl port-forward service/maple05-mysql 3306:3306
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3306 -> 3306
Forwarding from [::1]:3306 -> 3306


mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -paiImelyt
...
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

**Option 2.** Use an access address.

If you want to access a cluster via MySQL client, get the access address from `Endpoints` in the cluster details.
```bash
kbcli cluster describe maple05

...
Endpoints:
COMPONENT  MODE       INTERNAL          EXTERNAL
mysql      ReadWrite  10.43.29.51:3306  <none>
...
```

Besides accessing a cluster by `IP:PORT` in `Endpoints`, you can also use [the DNS service of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#dns) for service discovery. The format of DNS access is `${service_name}.${namespace}:${port}`.
For example, run the command below and the results show that there are two services in this database cluster. The namespace of Kubernetes is `default`. Then this database can be accessed via `mysql-cluster.default:3306` and `mysql-cluster-ac-mysql-headless.default:3306`.
```bash
kubectl get service | grep maple05

NAME                     CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                          
maple05-mysql-headless   None            <none>        3306/TCP,13306/TCP,9104/TCP,3501/TCP 
maple05-mysql            10.43.206.161   <none>        3306/TCP 
```

#### Delete an ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group

Run the command below to delete a specified database cluster. For example, 
```bash
kbcli cluster delete maple05

Please enter the name again(separate with commas when more than one): maple05
Cluster maple05 deleted
```

### Observability

KubeBlocks has complete observability capabilities. This section demonstrates the monitoring function of KubeBlocks. 

***Steps:***

1. Run the command below to view the monitoring page to observe the service running status.
   ```bash
   kbcli dashboard open kubeblocks-grafana

   Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 3000
   Forward successfully! Opening browser ...
   ```

   ***Result***

   A monitoring page is loaded automatically after the command is executed. 

2. Click the Dashboard icon on the left bar and two monitoring panels show on the page.
   ![Dashboards](../image/dashboards.png)
3. Click General -> MySQL to monitor the status of the ApeCloud MySQL cluster deployed by the playground.
   ![MySQL_panel](../image/mysql_panel.png)

### High availability of ApeCloud MySQL

ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group delivers high availability with RPO=0 and RTO in less than 30 seconds.
Here we use a simple failure simulation to show you the failure recovery capability of ApeCloud MySQL.

#### Simulate leader pod failure recovery

In this example, we delete the leader pod to simulate a failure.

***Steps:***

1. Run the command below to view the ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group information. View the leader pod name in `Topology`. In this example, the leader pod's name is maple05-mysql-2.
   ```bash
   kbcli cluster describe maple05
   >

2. Run the command below to delete the leader pod.
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod maple05-mysql-2

   pod "maple05-mysql-2" deleted
   ```

3. Run `kbcli cluster connect maple05` to connect to the ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group to test its availability. You can find this group can be accessed within seconds.
   ```bash
   kbcli cluster connect maple05
   >
   Connect to instance maple05-mysql-2: out of maple05-mysql-2(leader), maple05-mysql-0(follower)

#### Observe clusters by NON-STOP NYAN CAT
The above example uses `kbcli cluster connect` to test availability, in which the changes are not obvious to see.
NON-STOP NYAN CAT is a demo application to observe how the database cluster exceptions affect actual businesses. Animations and real-time key information display provided by NON-STOP NYAN CAT can directly show the availability influences of database services.

***Steps:***

1. Run the command below to install the NYAN CAT demo application.
   ```bash
   kbcli app install nyancat
   >
   Installing application nyancat OK
   Install nyancat SUCCESSFULLY!
   1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
   kubectl --namespace default port-forward service/nyancat 8087:8087
   echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8087 to use Nyan Cat demo application."
   ```

2. Use `port-forward` according to the hints above to expose an application port as available access for your local host, then visit this application via http://127.0.0.1:8087.
3. Delete the leader pod and view the influences on the ApeCloud MySQL clusters through the NYAN CAT page.
   ![NYAN CAT](../image/nyan_cat.png)
4. Uninstall the NYAN CAT demo application.
   ```bash
   kbcli app uninstall nyancat
   ```

## Uninstall the playground

Uninstalling the playground cleans up relevant component services and data:

* Delete all KubeBlocks database clusters, such as ApeCloud MySQL Paxos group
* Uninstall KubeBlocks
* Delete the local Kubernetes clusters created by K3d.
  
Run the command below to uninstall the playground.
```bash
kbcli playground destroy
```
