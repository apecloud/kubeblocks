spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Halt`: Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster. This field allows for detailed configuration of each component within the Cluster. Note: `shardingSpecs` and `componentSpecs` cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a cluster. ClusterComponentSpec defines the specifications for a Component in a Cluster.
