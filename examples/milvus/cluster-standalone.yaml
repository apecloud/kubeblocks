kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: milvus-standalone
  namespace: demo
spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # Valid options are: [DoNotTerminate, Delete, WipeOut] (`Halt` is deprecated since KB 0.9)
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterDefinition to use when creating a Cluster.
  # Note: DO NOT UPDATE THIS FIELD
  # The value must be `milvus` to create a Milvus Cluster
  clusterDef: milvus
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterTopology to be used when creating the
  # Cluster.
  # Valid options are: [standalone,cluster]
  topology: standalone
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the
  # individual Components that make up a Cluster.
  # This field allows for detailed configuration of each Component within the Cluster
