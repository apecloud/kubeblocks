  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.

  # Lists Expose objects, each specifying a Component and its services to be exposed.

  - componentName: mogdb
    # Specifies a list of OpsService. When an OpsService is exposed, a corresponding ClusterService will be added to `cluster.spec.services`. On the other hand, when an OpsService is unexposed, the corresponding ClusterService will be removed from `cluster.spec.services`. Note: If `componentName` is not specified, the `ports` and `selector` fields must be provided in each OpsService definition. OpsService represents the parameters to dynamically create or remove a ClusterService in the `cluster.spec.services` array.

    # Indicates whether the services will be exposed. 'Enable' exposes the services. while 'Disable' removes the exposed Service.
