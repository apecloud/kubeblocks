  # Specifies the name of the `StorageProvider` used by this backup repository.
  # Currently, KubeBlocks supports configuring various object storage services as backup repositories
  # - s3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)
  # - oss (Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service)
  # - cos (Tencent Cloud Object Storage)
  # - gcs (Google Cloud Storage)
  # - obs (Huawei Cloud Object Storage)
  # - minio, and other S3-compatible services.
  # Note: set the provider name to you own needs
  storageProviderRef: oss
  # Specifies the access method of the backup repository.
  # - Tool
  # - Mount
  # If the access mode is Mount, it will mount the PVC through the CSI driver (make sure it is installed and configured properly)
  # In Tool mode, it will directly stream to the object storage without mounting the PVC.
  accessMethod: Tool
  # Stores the non-secret configuration parameters for the `StorageProvider`.
  config:
    # Note: set the bucket name to you own needs
    bucket: <kubeblocks-test>
    # Note: set the region name to you own needs
    region: <cn-zhangjiakou>
  # References to the secret that holds the credentials for the `StorageProvider`.
  # kubectl create secret generic demo-credential-for-backuprepo --from-literal=accessKeyId=* --from-literal=secretAccessKey=* --namespace=kb-system
  credential:
    # name is unique within a namespace to reference a secret resource.
    # Note: set the secret name to you own needs
    name: <credential-for-backuprepo>
    # namespace defines the space within which the secret name must be unique.
    namespace: kb-system
  # Specifies reclaim policy of the PV created by this backup repository
  # Valid Options are [Retain, Delete]
  # Delete means the volume will be deleted from Kubernetes on release from its claim.
  # Retain means the volume will be left in its current phase (Released) for manual reclamation by the administrator.
