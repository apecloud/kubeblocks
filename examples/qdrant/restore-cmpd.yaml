spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Halt`: Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster. This field allows for detailed configuration of each component within the Cluster. Note: `shardingSpecs` and `componentSpecs` cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a cluster. ClusterComponentSpec defines the specifications for a Component in a Cluster. 
  componentSpecs:
    # Specifies the name of the Component. This name is also part of the Service DNS name and must comply with the IANA service naming rule. When ClusterComponentSpec is referenced as a template, the name is optional. Otherwise, it is required.
  - name: qdrant
    # References the name of a ComponentDefinition. The ComponentDefinition specifies the behavior and characteristics of the Component. If both `componentDefRef` and `componentDef` are provided, the `componentDef` will take precedence over `componentDefRef`.
    componentDef: qdrant
    # Specifies a group of affinity scheduling rules for the Component. It allows users to control how the Component's Pods are scheduled onto nodes in the cluster.
    affinity:
      podAntiAffinity: Preferred
      topologyKeys:
      - kubernetes.io/hostname
      tenancy: SharedNode
    # Determines whether the metrics exporter needs to be published to the service endpoint. If set to true, the metrics exporter will be published to the service endpoint, the service will be injected with the following annotations: - "monitor.kubeblocks.io/path" - "monitor.kubeblocks.io/port" - "monitor.kubeblocks.io/scheme"
    monitorEnabled: false
    # Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount required by the running Component. This ServiceAccount is used to grant necessary permissions for the Component's Pods to interact with other Kubernetes resources, such as modifying pod labels or sending events. Defaults: If not specified, KubeBlocks automatically assigns a default ServiceAccount named "kb-{cluster.name}", bound to a default role defined during KubeBlocks installation. Future Changes: Future versions might change the default ServiceAccount creation strategy to one per Component, potentially revising the naming to "kb-{cluster.name}-{component.name}". Users can override the automatic ServiceAccount assignment by explicitly setting the name of an existed ServiceAccount in this field.
    serviceAccountName: kb-qdrant-cluster
    # Each component supports running multiple replicas to provide high availability and persistence. This field can be used to specify the desired number of replicas.
    replicas: 3
    # Specifies the resources required by the Component. It allows defining the CPU, memory requirements and limits for the Component's containers.
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
      requests:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
    # Specifies a list of PersistentVolumeClaim templates that define the storage requirements for the Component. Each template specifies the desired characteristics of a persistent volume, such as storage class, size, and access modes. These templates are used to dynamically provision persistent volumes for the Component when it is deployed.
    volumeClaimTemplates:
    - name: data
      spec:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 30Gi
