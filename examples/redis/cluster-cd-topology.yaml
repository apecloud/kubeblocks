spec:
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterDefinition to use when creating a Cluster.
  clusterDefinitionRef: redis
  # Specifies the redis cluster topology defined in ClusterDefinition.Spec.topologies, support standalone, replication, and replication-twemproxy.
  # - `standalone`: single redis instance
  # - `replication`: primary-secondary replication with redis sentinel, refer: https://redis.io/docs/management/sentinel
  # - `replication-twemproxy`: primary-secondary replication with sentinel and twemproxy, it is just a demo for how to use twemproxy with redis, not recommended for production
  topology: replication
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Halt`: Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster.
  componentSpecs:
    # Specifies the name of the Component. The name must be defined in the ClusterDefinition.Spec.topologies[x].components.
    # This name is also part of the Service DNS name and must comply with the IANA service naming rule. When ClusterComponentSpec is referenced as a template, the name is optional. Otherwise, it is required.

      # Specifies which types of logs should be collected for the Cluster.

      # Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount required by the running Component.
