spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Halt`: Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster. 
  componentSpecs:
    # Specifies the name of the Component. This name is also part of the Service DNS name and must comply with the IANA service naming rule. 
  - name: weaviate
    # References the name of a ComponentDefinition. The ComponentDefinition specifies the behavior and characteristics of the Component. If both `componentDefRef` and `componentDef` are provided, the `componentDef` will take precedence over `componentDefRef`.
    componentDef: weaviate
    # Specifies a group of affinity scheduling rules for the Component. It allows users to control how the Component's Pods are scheduled onto nodes in the cluster.

      - kubernetes.io/hostname
      tenancy: SharedNode
    # Allows the Component to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.

    # Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount required by the running Component.

    # Each component supports running multiple replicas to provide high availability and persistence. This field can be used to specify the desired number of replicas.
    replicas: 2
    # Specifies the resources required by the Component. It allows defining the CPU, memory requirements and limits for the Component's containers.
