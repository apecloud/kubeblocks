	// after updating it may miss to see the changes.
	// while in most cases this problem can be mitigated by retrying later in an idempotent
	// manner, there are some cases where it cannot, for example if a decision is to be made
	// that has side-effect operations such as returning an error message to the user
	// (in webhook) or deleting certain resources (in controllerutil.HandleCRDeletion).
	// additionally, retry loops cause unnecessary delays when reconciliations are processed.
	// for the sake of performance, now only the objects created by the end-user is listed here,
	// to solve the two problems mentioned above.
	// consider carefully before adding new objects to this list.
